MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0021.wav Is not to participate what an outrage please get a life you under say to them you know tht is is not something we should be particularly 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0022.wav Surprised about this is a a very consistent a position it's not the first time 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0023.wav Were seeing already with the bush administration and eska 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0024.wav Lation in the pace of the abandonment of international commitments the abandonment of the ab m treat 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0026.wav But this is something that's a matter of quickening the pace 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0027.wav Its not qualitatively different it was under clinton 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0028.wav We should note that we tried we the united states and i used that term advisedly

MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0035.wav That was his words i thought what a great you know home homebody

MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0038.wav D be there cause we don't want a pick on our friend o k well he's right no 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0041.wav Practices around the world i think that's a serious problem 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0042.wav I do not think that singling out israel is appropriat 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0043.wav Israel maybe at the top of the list but it ain't 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0045.wav And iam sorry that in because of the intensity of the u s opposition 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0046.wav It's given way it's given an excuse to diminish all of these other serious questions of racism 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0048.wav Acism is a sloppy formulation it's far more complex than tha 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0050.wav As we heard a minute ago so eloquently zionism is essentially the issue of settler colonialism and like all settler colonial projects 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0052.wav T but it is not only racist and i think that we blur a lot of categories by reducing it to that 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0053.wav All of the kind of north south interactions in the age of colonial expansions around the world 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0055.wav The interaction as it were from the time of columbus were thoroughly races interactions 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0056.wav The motion of westward expansion was a thoroughly racist reality 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0057.wav No more no less than the ziones project 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0059.wav I have a slight difference in emphasis perhaps on the history that the early zionists 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0061.wav The movement of political zcionism which always distinguished itself from religious zianism was never particularly tied to the land until it 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0062.wav Became clear that that was where they had the best in palestine i mean 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0064.wav To antisematism the pogrums particularly in russia somewhat less in eastern europe and and much less in western 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0066.wav Quote in one of his writings where he said i will now tell you ashe i kno 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0068.wav Industry it needed a varied climate because jews 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0069.wav Would be coming from all over the world and used to different kinds of climates it was very it made 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0071.wav Logical there was nothing mystical and there was nothing religious about 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0072.wav There was nothing religious about it that came later as we heard as part of the 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0073.wav Apologetics it wasn't inherent in political zcienism so people like mygrand 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0075.wav In russia in nineteen o six i think it was didn't think of going 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0076.wav Palestine at that time he came to the united states which had the biggest a concentration of jews in the world who were escaping all kinds of pegrums and 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0077.wav Antisemetica tax in stuff all over the world it was only sort 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0078.wav Was only later that palestine became synonymous with this notion of political 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0079.wav Zianism i think we cawe can look at it theoretically we can analyze 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0080.wav Language i would say probably ethnicity is closer than race to define jews around the 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0081.wav World aas we know race doesn't exist in some in some scientific precise way either race itself is a social 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0082.wav Construction and its definitions vary in different societies it plays a different role in differen 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0083.wav Societies what is clear is that jews were oppressed as a group whether we want to call it racial oppressi an ethnic oppression religious 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0085.wav Severe it was very severe at some periods and in some places it changed at times and at 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0086.wav Ther times it only got worse if we look at the isralely ju 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0088.wav Nos sixty per cent of the jews are arabs sixty per cent of the jews i'm not even talking about the twenty per cent of the population that are palistinians i'm tongi about the jew 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0089.wav Se sixty per cent of them are arabs another what four five per cent something like that are etheopians and only the rest are white so this notion that its 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0090.wav Race that defines the population is a troubling one 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0091.wav But you know what the theory is great for debates 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0093.wav Between the ideal and the possible i 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0094.wav Absolutely agree that the fundamental solution two the problems of 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0096.wav Pation of discrimination the 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0097.wav Go on in israel and in the occupied territories to day can only emerge in the context of one state where everybody is equal on the basis of one 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0098.wav Perse an one vote all the things we like to think are true here although we know they're not but i'm a realist i'm not an 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0100.wav Over zionism in racism is emerging the way it is because i don't think it's something 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0102.wav You know if you compare the crisis in palestine to day would say the crisis that emerged around the genecide in uanda in 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0103.wav Nineteen ninety four it was shocking for people to see these images on television but people in this country recognized what the hell is this where are where is th 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0105.wav People why are they fighting there was a recognition of 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0106.wav Ignorance it didn't mean that those of us who tried to do some education about that issue 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0108.wav Not but there was a recognition 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0109.wav Ignorance the problem we face to day is much more severe because it's not only 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0110.wav Ignorance its the assumption of knowledge because in this country almost everybody grows 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0112.wav Out israel and what they know are basically three 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0113.wav Things israel is like us israel is 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0115.wav Terrorice that's what people know but the problem is they know 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0116.wav Oint it's not just something they read and it passes by it's fundamental to he 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0117.wav Culture here and it isn't only what people read in the newspaper that helps it isn't only what they hear on television in radio in whatever that helps but it's infused through 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0118.wav Culture you know what we really need to transform 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0119.wav We need lee on urus to write exidus from the other side and paul numan to play the starring roll that muvi 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0120.wav Transformed public opinion in this country massively in a way that i think we're only now in some ways starting to 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0121.wav Understand the question of the privileging of jews inside israel and as inherent in the nature of 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0123.wav Rites i think that's a way of talking that people can begin to come to grips with even in in the midst of this 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0125.wav Fundamental it's not surprising that this issue has absolutely superseded everything else at the racesm conference in 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0128.wav Palestine it makes perfect sense because they see the parallels but there are vast differences as well and we 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0130.wav Africa there are absolutely important parallels and we need to continue to do that education 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0133.wav Us cease fire how do we impose the mitchel report all of 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0134.wav This is nonsense because it doesn't address 
MSP-PODCAST_1369_0002_0135.wav Occupation there was a call from the israeli piece group gush 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0002_0003.wav Sun came out and were here elms 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0002_0005.wav This project has been the most incredible experience of my entire life 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0002_0007.wav These stories about these forty eight black women who really developed 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0002_0008.wav Am chicago an a lot of different areas to be oble to tell their stories and make sure that their lives are remembered andd that their stories 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0002_0009.wav E herd is just is just such an honor to me 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0002_0011.wav Um um i try th nowa down you know there's forty eight in il 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0002_0013.wav Were tring sir really bring to readers by telling the stories of these 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0001.wav Ary alabama addie was also a leader in the struggle for the equal rites am iit eleanor 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0002.wav Rolosevell appointed addie to the united states commissional n estatus of women in the early nineteen sixties and then she became a founding member of the national organization for women 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0004.wav Their resums are so extensive that i'm just like a part of my admiration for these women come from the space of like 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0005.wav In one lifetime you can accomplish so much and not just on an individual level so many of these women were like institution builders 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0007.wav But they were also heavily involved in organizations throughout chicago 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0009.wav Ye'll see that we include aadditional filiations 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0010.wav So you can see that most of the forty women have about like three to five 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0011.wav Some even ten organizations associated with the name that they founded that they worked with it was just 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0013.wav Aminin she went on to found the colition for laborer union for women specifically 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0014.wav She gave a speech in front of three thousand and two hundred women um she was quated as saying phracysm and sexysm is an economic issue 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0016.wav It is very profitable to discriminate against women and against people of ca 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0017.wav I began to understand that change could come see you 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0018.wav But you cannot do it alone you have to unite others 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0019.wav That was one of the reasons i became a part of a union 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0020.wav It was a family that would help in the struggle 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0021.wav Also very interesting about addie is that she was in ninety seventy five along with the palitician barber joredin 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0022.wav One of the first african american women to be named by tom magazine as person of the year 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0024.wav She is one of the women in our but that really go cona tipto inte you know the twenty first century 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0026.wav Um one of the things that i like to uplift as well is that so for each woman 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0028.wav We paire because they have connections to a particular institu 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0029.wav Tion or location so the guide batcada would take you through their stories by location by location 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0030.wav But atis is te disaphels high school 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0031.wav Ie what pass in te sabels high school had no idea how rich in history

MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0036.wav And was built to alleviate the severely overcrowded conditions of wend 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0038.wav Wonderfulips high school is also one that we include in the book 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0040.wav When i was talking about ant madelle boosville im who is an educator im that we include in the text and through their halls 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0041.wav They have like holifane and you would be so surprised to know how 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0042.wav Many powerful and important people graduated from thi school and dissivals is very similar in that way 
MSP-PODCAST_1420_0011_0043.wav It was basicly am
