MSP-PODCAST_1168_0043_0005.wav It's a different kind of mystery so by putting distance between adler and the readers 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0043_0006.wav It sort of adds an element of mystery even though this isn't really a mystery story 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0045_0002.wav An unprecedented move for watson to remove himself from the case of it and at the beginning of certain cases o we'll have this disclaimer alike oh 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0045_0007.wav Ing a male aniance are we is this like a man verses woman think i don't think it is but i do think it's interesting a note that why 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0045_0008.wav Sand establishes that distance he is also doing something else and regardless of what is other motives for 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0045_0010.wav Also working very hard to distance allar from homes na in particular as a rhomantic interest look at the first protaragraph of a story watson spend so much 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0061_0002.wav Like really affects your view of sherlock and of gender in the series i guess in the larger context of all the holmes short stories i 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0061_0003.wav Inclined to say that addler does not represent feminity as a whole or women as a whole i i don't think she makes any universal 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0061_0005.wav The reason i say this is because skin 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0061_0006.wav Landell tis era skindal in bohenia is not the only home story there's billions on home 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0061_0008.wav Their married women unmarried women young women and old women

MSP-PODCAST_1168_0061_0016.wav But he does still make generalizing remarks and i think that's just he's a victorian man 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0061_0017.wav Dogger of course he's going to do that e and no matter how much he rejects the conventional in his life he's stoken embodies some of his society's patriar

MSP-PODCAST_1168_0104_0003.wav Pass and i think people have told him probably in his childhood 
MSP-PODCAST_1168_0104_0005.wav So he probably second guesses these carrying feelings and i think sort of his victory at the end of ryken back was 
MSP-PODCAST_1169_0002_0001.wav Eh so i should have you literary 
MSP-PODCAST_1169_0002_0002.wav Arness as a giant non norrative umbrella

MSP-PODCAST_1169_0002_0012.wav It's temporary so she can go off and find the man that she supokes to marry and then she stops when she gets married if you look at twelfth night 
MSP-PODCAST_1169_0013_0003.wav Richy verses i read in more like a variety of disguises in the movies as they gam her very pretty outfits 
MSP-PODCAST_1169_0015.wav Really you know ju wellworks way better and dry

MSP-PODCAST_1208_0094_0002.wav Hybread which i thought was really reliquil 
MSP-PODCAST_1208_0094_0004.wav Heah what was shon didn't show off that much game play 
MSP-PODCAST_1208_0104.wav I don't consider that an actual metura game ike its just like a recap of the other meturi games

MSP-PODCAST_1208_0112_0002.wav As the er the e three of the sequels cause i mean mod 
MSP-PODCAST_1208_0113_0001.wav Ealized that they lost lot of corps gamers and that's cont of the reason behind this new supermaryor brothers 
MSP-PODCAST_1208_0113_0002.wav The new supermariogalaxy and this much more matur 
MSP-PODCAST_1208_0113_0004.wav They showed off the traila for the conduet which is coming out in three weeks 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0008_0001.wav Here's the way i sa and intend don really fool dus

MSP-PODCAST_1209_0008_0003.wav I thought everything was going to be like one to one motion with what was on the t b and then we got we sports and that felt like it was close to one to one 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0008_0006.wav Hat was just a really well designed game and then now we get all these other games that it's just like oh shake the control 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0013_0003.wav Your we remote it's no longer impressive like your not you're no longer woud by oh i can waggle 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0013_0004.wav My wermote a little bit angaian screenal swing his sword like it's not overly impressive so you need to come back and do something to get us back into it 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0015_0002.wav I think it's going to do a job obno can say if it's gotter bad 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0015_0003.wav We honestly don't know but i think that for the wemotion plus to catch on 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0015_0004.wav It has to be included in every we remote from here onow because 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0022_0003.wav Change their haristyle it could detect finger movements with precision and ease 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0022_0004.wav It was just amazing at what this thing can do and i honestly think adit will be the best idne 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0028_0002.wav Out all of wee's motion is the tec 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0028_0003.wav Ed by excelerometers within the controller itself and transferred through blue tooth to the system itself ah just a little clarification 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0030.wav Theyall involve a camera of sorts 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0032_0002.wav You know it's it's very difficult to say which ones 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0035_0001.wav Ii just thought of a different aspect of this as that with projecnatal you don't have anything 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0043_0001.wav I like id give some give some great examples of a rail shoters like time crise as house of the dead 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0043_0002.wav Star like that e bit bastartly an any any shooteer you've seen in an arcade that only has guns that's basicliette 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0049.wav And i can't wait until the next one comes out which is probably t had bettergraphics and is probably just going to be just so much better 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0051_0001.wav Yep he claims at itts the best wee graphic 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0051_0004.wav Steady camra you're going to get a quick gidtery camer that moves all around the environment like yer 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0053_0001.wav Else what else i think is cool about this gane though is that um in umbrella chronicles when we were playing alone 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0053_0002.wav You you couldn't see your partner in what you're playing 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0053_0004.wav The dark side chronicles you can actually see your partner on screen with 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0058.wav Nin knowing cap colm they seem to be going all cooff these days and eain resinue of five hason line coop so it it won't surprise me if they do some form of anlyne coopu obviously it kand of coo because is his 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0068.wav I think the otherthing it's the ability to develop for them i don't know how easy itis to develop for the d s or the deasia should say i really 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0076_0002.wav In my mind this possibly could have the best graphics for the wee and i mean i think notendos really trying to go for the hardcort gamers 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0076_0003.wav Now especially with their announcement that the bringing very mature version of metroid 
MSP-PODCAST_1209_0087_0002.wav So in a coupl of weeks we're prob you're just goingto hear me nic

MSP-PODCAST_1210_0150.wav Ow it makes somewhat chronological sense i

MSP-PODCAST_1210_0153.wav Ye but see that doesn't make sense to some one who doesn't know a call a duty as you're saying oh they went from worldwar too to modern day warfare andthey went back to worldward too in modern a wawar 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0154.wav Ather white writers like a sub that's like a sub tidle underneath the main title which is call of duty 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0168.wav That's why i wish they didn't put call duty herecause then they could have they could have one series called modern warfare and they could have another one called kall duty world at war

MSP-PODCAST_1210_0210_0005.wav Letter turin film and the first thing i have to say is i thought first amon what was 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0210_0006.wav Freedom of speech not on understand why the federal governments prosecuting literature and film for freedom of speech but that's not the point 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0220_0001.wav I know and it it stuffed like this in which they made it every one p 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0220_0003.wav Or thinking about creating a stake baby that's eaten by a lion 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0223_0002.wav Is say i think this is the type of thing like saying oh we should 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0223_0003.wav Rat a pen in paper too becau 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0223_0005.wav N like what this game is rated so like i don't know hopefully little kids aren't 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0223_0007.wav O i don't know make the lion eat the baby make the lion puke up the baby  no like adon

MSP-PODCAST_1210_0235.wav And now no i don't like the spot i don't like ti of this vn 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0236_0001.wav Is that this the worst why 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0243_0002.wav It's one thing to say people like violente i think it's another to say 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0243_0003.wav That most of the people in the world are good 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0243_0005.wav O games give us a pearl to see what happens if we are bad 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0246_0001.wav Egins are used as an escape from mike realitina 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0248_0001.wav Ow i not ant one game that does is a fall out three which i 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0248_0002.wav Got off of steam and it's interesting because there are certain 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0248_0003.wav Items you can use if youre if your carm is good are your 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0248_0004.wav Armer's bat er even if your carme is neutral so it all depends on which path you want to take 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0259.wav It that's another thing is that is wa does violence is violent is blood required to be considered violence cosiliks now yo my 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0261.wav Because if they know if blood is required to be violent then al mario games are fined because there's no blood in them 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0262_0001.wav V then you have games like papromario and ma masamar r p g 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0265_0001.wav We are at our final story which is amazing because normally 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0265_0004.wav This article last night i down lod to the game it was associated with and im going to say looks pretty 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0265_0005.wav Coal and the entire its basically o 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0265_0006.wav Idio game that creates its own content now vasidly the way the game works is 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0265_0007.wav Ah youare a ship in space and you have three weapons you can choose 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0265_0009.wav An enemy base you can take a power up and add it to one of those existing items a one are your existing weapons but the way the w t 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0265_0010.wav The weapons evolve is based on previous attribute 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0265_0011.wav That your weapons have had so like if you have one weapon like 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0267_0006.wav That so it's not like the game can just do whatever the hellet wants like it it needs whatever it always has to meet whatever boundaries are set by the programmer yathers 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0268_0001.wav Obviously boundaries but here's a thing is that the wather doing it is the using ma 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0268_0002.wav Hematical equations using it its called procedral programme 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0268_0003.wav In which instead of what most programmers 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0268_0006.wav Ou call customsation and it's the same way spor works and it's one of the reason 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0277_0001.wav Ichbag doesn't work right 
MSP-PODCAST_1210_0277_0002.wav Hi knows welcome to the bar

MSP-PODCAST_1347_0010_0015.wav We went to a canada on a honeymoon 
MSP-PODCAST_1347_0010_0017.wav But then that depression came along in nineteen twenty nine and prevented that so he ended up with a
