MSP-PODCAST_0260_0393_0001.wav Ngs to politics  they look at republicans and conservatives an to them that were the same selet jus call it that way o cages i'm talking from their perspective ri 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0393_0002.wav We are people who disapprove of them and want to tell them how to live their lives 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0394.wav In other words they believe we want to control their lives and so when youe 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0396_0001.wav Amazing isn't it what akan and the reason is this and i yonging t be speaking this a sunday night down in parker and i always explained this when i speak 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0396_0002.wav Because people are like why why do young people think that we want to control their lives in the left us here's why 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0396_0003.wav Because on about ninety five per cent of the issues we on the right give freedom we give liberty 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0400_0001.wav But here's the problem unvirtually all that virtually all that they don't known any of it 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0400_0002.wav They don't own businesses they don't create jobs their health care ther on their parents they don't have a they don't deal with water wrights landwrights mineral rights 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0400_0003.wav The only thing they own is their bodies ay and that's the only thing they perceive us is trying to control is how what they do with their body 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0400_0004.wav By the way you know me i'm a social conservative i don't say don't talk about that stuff i say offer and modelate don't force it 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0402_0001.wav Exactly i hot morality can't get enough of the stuff it's great voque them 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0402_0002.wav Oi like to think that christian morality is the morality that you wish you had the night before i 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0404.wav Thing it's something where you you wake up the next anger like a'm glad i had that morality last night 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0406.wav Ret's morality isn't that a nedo thing but here's beon it does matter for your christian or not when we tell them what to do with their bodies 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0407_0001.wav They take that very personal because to them that's only even though that's only five per cent of the issues and really folcs it's only like one per cent but let's say it's five 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0407_0002.wav Even though at's only five percent of the issues that's their one hundred per cent a as far as they're concerned you we and the right are controlling their entire life lives o k 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0407_0003.wav And so that's why they see us that way so we can say we'll wait a minute everything else in life we give you liberty to them they're like i don't own any of that 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0410_0001.wav That's what we woring so when when you talk to a young person it's very very important that you first diffuse the idea that they that you want to control their lives 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0410_0002.wav Then you can launch into any kind of issues and i definitely want to get into free college here after the break but 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0410_0003.wav You know the first thing you want to do is connect with them and show them that what you that you believe in them the reason you want things this way o the reason you believe in conservative ideals 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0410_0004.wav Is ecause you want them unleashed not because you want them leasht

MSP-PODCAST_0260_0414_0004.wav I think io fifteen dollar menmum wageis a great idea cause the second thing after listening is fined the area of that that is commendable

MSP-PODCAST_0260_0417_0002.wav But you want to take into account that they think you want to control their lives that's why you have to first open the door before you go in the house 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0417_0003.wav And that doorway is a doorway of above the mantl says you want to control me stay out so you had to show i don't want to control you let me in 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0418.wav And and you do that by listening you do that by finding that piece that that they are embracing that says i don't want to be controlled in whatever liberal policy it is 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0419.wav Can even do it by challenging em hey i knon ho i want to control my own life not yours can you say the same

MSP-PODCAST_0260_0456_0001.wav Liten to me it sounds like a a parasitic idea and the first thing that comes to my mind is 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0456_0002.wav If our cay through twelve system is so broken how about we fix that instead of remediating it by giving two more years of schooling away 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0457.wav Chris that's crazy talk don't you understand now iremember i'm a child left i was raised by the left if something isn't working do more of it

MSP-PODCAST_0260_0478.wav Hat they're they're afraid they're backing up for e mascou this why do you get a high school degree or g d why do you get that 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0480.wav Because you want to prove that you have enough perseverance to actually make it though chool e 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0483_0001.wav Ause until you get your high school degree your diploma you can't go off to college get get a good job or may bou go ing the military any of these things you can't move on from there 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0483_0002.wav Ga oke what we've done is you get a high school degree or g d because that's the starting line in life 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0484.wav The lowest commendentanis the minimum requirements 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0485_0001.wav Right and when i talk about this with young people they get that immediately rigt i say why do yu at a high school degree i say isn't it because you're trying to get to the starting line in life 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0485_0002.wav At's just the starting line that's the minimum that you have to have if you don't have that you're ot a tremendous disadvantage right in the go ya asher as aca 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0485_0003.wav Why is it why is that the starting line why isn't it a master's degree the starting line 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0485_0004.wav Or six grade only six grade the starting lane why is the starting line happene to be 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0486_0001.wav High school why do you have to have that degree to have a chance just to get started in life 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0486_0002.wav And they look atme like ouli don't know and i telem it's very simple because it's free 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0486_0003.wav See everything that's free everybody has or can have 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0486_0004.wav All right and so whatever you make free that is going to set where the starting line is in life 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0486_0005.wav Ok we've made it free through grade twelve which means that that is where you start and can leap forward in life 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0486_0006.wav Now here's a question ah what happens if we give you two more years a free college 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0487_0001.wav Well before we go there g and well this is gras ri's radio colorado and cales ze five sixty is is christ cook i andy pate of the courtiet 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0487_0002.wav Of the party of choice i'm i'm going to get quarry's name in there somewhere sono or what 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0487_0003.wav Here's my point the left argument is that the starting line is no longer a high school diploma the starting line is at least two years of college 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0493.wav Something that's so preposterous ah that is ridiculous al but this is to come back let me ask you this chris chrisse 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0496.wav Tage ah why do you get a college degree why would you go get a college degree 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0498_0001.wav Right you want an advantage so you want to get an advantage with the college degree but it only gives you a advantage over who those who don't have college degrees right 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0498_0002.wav Right once again you're back to the same argument whatever is free that's the starting point the reason you get a college degree is because you wanht to go past that starting point 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0498_0003.wav If we may get free through a two more years of college we've always done his establish a new starting point 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0498_0004.wav You have no advantage then so now rather than getting that high school degree an coming out with an advantage 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0498_0005.wav You have to get fourteen well fifteen years yo kennegern so cathrou twelfth rather than thirteen years now it takes fifteen years just to get to the starting line 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0501.wav Got to get a better college degree or military or go into the work force 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0504.wav As well o q a they have free college education in england and that's not really the case is it 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0505.wav Ah don't know much bout england arbian 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0507_0001.wav No i do know that europe is a mess right and so i wouldn't want to emulate it in anything 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0507_0002.wav Ee i me seriously why would i want to emulate a continent that is so far in debt 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0508.wav That it's completely falling apart i right i don't want to look i don' wanta look to failures as my example 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0510_0001.wav What i would do when i when i look at a young person i say look bottom mine the reason you get a high school degrees that's the starting line 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0510_0002.wav The reason that's the starting line is cause it's free as far as you extend free that is where the minimum will become 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0511.wav That's where everybody is going to be everybody youre competing against 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0514.wav So now exactly so now youre having to spend fifteen years just to get to the starting line 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0532.wav Well basically this there's one thing worse than putting back the finish line and that's moving back the starting line we're gongto make you wait two years longer to start 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0552.wav It's wafting through the studio so where aryuon to go next 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0583.wav Them come up against the reality of the situation and then let them speak 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0584.wav And what are you what are they usually come back with an i got nothing i'm sitting heu're going e 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0598.wav If you do it if you truse if you beat them over the head with your talking points which probably are very good they feel controlled right it doesn't matter if you win the debate cause you've lost them 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0619.wav And that's about all they own at this point an time ind their lives 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0627.wav Jesus and i'll tell young people this te'll say did you know that jesus when did jesus and the apostles ever try to make non christians live like christians 
MSP-PODCAST_0260_0630.wav So you're probably so now you're your young person you'r christy again i know you
