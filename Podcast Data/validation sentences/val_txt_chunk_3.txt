MSP-PODCAST_0744_0121_0003.wav That because i was so young it's like i wasn't expecting to be ble to relate to any of it so i would 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0122.wav By like italian vogue but skip everything until the photo aditorments 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0123_0001.wav And then i was just excited by it and i felt so far removed from it

MSP-PODCAST_0744_0124.wav They were just like dolls or aliens and i felt like i could just kind of be excited by the clothes and and write about 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0125.wav T that and then when i started im

MSP-PODCAST_0744_0136.wav Don't have stuff that's like like some of it is more about fashion as self expression in a a way of being super creative and not worrying about 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0137.wav Ah likwearing something flattering i still also don't want girls to feel like they have to be 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0138_0002.wav So't i look more put together and like my skin is even or whatever so they're' stuff like that too 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0139.wav Bu im ye i

MSP-PODCAST_0744_0145_0001.wav Interested in what you are wearing and interested in what you look like is not utually exclusive from being political writ 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0145_0002.wav That makes a lot of sense to me as always made a walesense to me i've always been o 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0146_0003.wav Back lash i mean there is a backlash but the idea of focusing 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0146_0004.wav On yourself is like not feminism or focussing on his nuttigs is not feminis 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0148_0001.wav Sometimes the things that speak to me stylistically are because there's some kind of pressure or standard 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0148_0002.wav I feel i need to meet ah as to how i look but i think most of the things that resinate with me as theti

MSP-PODCAST_0744_0181_0001.wav Am like i would love to that's my next prad 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0182.wav I i ido i guess it' non too much about lake

MSP-PODCAST_0744_0186.wav And a maybe people who are superinto aschool and excelling in their studies feel that way or something but 
MSP-PODCAST_0744_0187.wav But for me there's some of that or i'm like all i have

MSP-PODCAST_0744_0190_0001.wav Element that makes it special like hone i moved into a new apartment this year

MSP-PODCAST_0845_0360.wav The next question is there should be no requirement to register as a fore sensitive with the galactic empire 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0363.wav Pri go six yo ho maybe even fefty 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0368.wav Yes  i went maybe here he still a politician it's easy to see him like requiring at least some kind of is inspections probably a bit more so than regulations so to speak 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0369_0002.wav Or he needed to get informating a information or material fom one location to another and wanted to skirt those regulations so at the same time i think he would probably be against this beriel 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0375.wav Nabe on thatla as se science and technological advancement should not be controlled or regulated by the empire 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0376_0001.wav I wont agree here that i believed if he received reports of a person or companies conducting some kind of unethical business is especially involving humanity that he would likely take some kind of action 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0379.wav I don't disagee with that either so taxation is theft including sovereign planetary funds taken by the empire as tribute 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0380_0003.wav A lot of the money fonneled towards the rebellion also likely came in the form of some kind of taxation so that's i that's where i went with it 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0396_0002.wav Land eat asigt not only do i use about the hard cuverb of the hard the hard back book i also get the audible book as well 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0396_0003.wav I can switch back and forth her so if ion i'm driving back a fortho worik i listen and the 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0396_0009.wav Thron te stuff as well the riguorthoron trilogy but she's amazing every book that she's done shs has bt e ben amazing and this book is in the top three of my new 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0396_0012.wav A iho sothree of her five an three of her books were in my top five em she's that good and she rights layis so well she did and w 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0396_0014.wav And so this book happens right  a couple of years before us seeing lea in rebels and a new hope  she's about sixteen 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0404.wav Nd so much but clautyagrey is a master at putting those little titbits in there without it being four 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0406_0002.wav Which is great an so the spoll ar warning going forward for the rest of this  little review can 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0408_0003.wav In this book and dab in she helps out layer alaming this book 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0408_0008.wav That's the salt covered plan it the you sing h last jed i were there the re gra as beat 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0410_0001.wav As when she really finds out and it goes through this whole story line of her parents are distant from her in shes e know really upset about this and then she finds out why 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0410_0003.wav Bass it completely changes the shift of everything and a so we hal so now this was a really meat nugget a qarash panaka memberhelm from a episode one 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0417.wav He pops up back in this book ye e hes has a moth for the empire in this book 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0429_0004.wav Work in these awful conditions and this is a calbag to when mace was theorizing after a after that of 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0433_0006.wav I im and it's basically an origin story of lea so if you're inta lea 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0433_0008.wav To read nice read but lod lines too but you got pick ut thisordin story as that's really what it is 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0435_0001.wav Nd so i you get it at resist the empire pod cast out calm slash laa that ill take you t amazon using aura amazon 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0437_0007.wav Athe major take away from this book is the fact that fasm is out for fasma only and that's it above all else fastoms out for fastin 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0438.wav So she really is in it for herself and cont a not like the 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0439_0005.wav Lana context is to why she so easily shut down the shells to struck at her base because 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0449_0002.wav No one will see the real phasthma until the moment when what the first order wants is no longer 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0453.wav Ough the end of the book shows the phashma going back to parnasses to make her shiny crome armor from the scraps of the nebu yacht that presumably once belong o balpoting and this was ka tha the ship that 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0458_0002.wav So another nugget is that these first order ships have a supersuperpowerful tracarpine that we haven't heard about yet and a and the resistance knows nothing about it 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0458_0003.wav I mean they are completely clues clueless to this at make seeker the first horasmsh assuming that's going to come up at the first 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0481.wav This is dawcon's first book for hostro hours a 
MSP-PODCAST_0845_0486_0007.wav Hisregards now he wants to know where solo is and three
