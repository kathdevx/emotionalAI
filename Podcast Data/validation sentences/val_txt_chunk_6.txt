MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0004.wav Im mi ter tell you a little tale poetically hopefully 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0005.wav Aum that's a near miss of a tragedy 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0006.wav Am it came about years and years ago and i wanted to write about the subject for a large number of years 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0007.wav And every time i tried to do it over the the coming years 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0008.wav It always sounded a bit crap if i'm honest 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0009.wav Am until one day madad who knew that i was struggling with how to approach this 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0010.wav Said to me because he's a much smart man than me 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0011.wav I've got this phrase going round my head an i dontno 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0012.wav D maybe you could do something with it and being the dutiful son that i am i wrote it down in my little notebook and 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0014.wav That the problem is that the phrase that he gave me relates to marine biology specifically how pearls are formed naturally in oysters 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0015.wav Now i don't know if everybody's familiar with how this works 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0016.wav Just in case when all kind of marine biology students 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0017.wav I know i wasn't and a way the way that a pearl is formed naturally in an oyster is that an irretent of some form gets inside the shell and the oyster can't get rid of it 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0019.wav It does mean however that people are wearing as decorative jewelry 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0020.wav What is to all intents and purposes oysters not 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0021.wav I'm sorry of that ruins it for anybody but 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0023.wav An and now what cin ov done the marine biology thing 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0024.wav I can tell you the phrase that mydad gave me and it became the title it is 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0025.wav It's the grit that makes the peal 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0026.wav Now i should tell you this before we start this is a topic very close to my heart 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0027.wav It is a tale of past events and in turn what they have meant to me in terms of who i am now 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0028.wav The words i umspeaking will hopefully show how that the title of the poem is ultimately true 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0029.wav So now i'm going to begin the story for y 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0030.wav Throughout my schooling i was always considered tall 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0031.wav I did well in my lessons though by no means oranor would never suggest that 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0033.wav But the combination of my height that when starting primary school 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0034.wav I could already read and write and that i never really ever put up much of a fight in my defence men that i became some one to tease 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0035.wav The kids could get a reaction from me with apparent neasond because 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0036.wav I always wanted to please i kept it inside 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0037.wav I kept it to myself and though i didn't know it at the time 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0038.wav Y let it affect my mental health despite knowing in my heart 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0039.wav That there are wealth of options available for me to take 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0041.wav I made a mistake that many of us still continue to make 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0042.wav I didn't reech out when i should have done 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0043.wav I let the kids carry on with their fond thinking that when i change school 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0045.wav Aunts and punches that came away and all breaks and lunches in constant demoralizing painful bunches 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0047.wav To this branew scool with his very visual antibullyon rule that finally everything would be called 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0048.wav But i came to quickly realize that school policy was meant for parents eyes and was not in effect for some one of my size 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0049.wav So when the bullying started i went to the teacher 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0050.wav I begged and i pleaded i tried to beseech her to make use of the schools 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0052.wav But what i was told what the teacher chose to say was that help was not going to come my way 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0053.wav That i would have to suffer day after day week after week with no end in sight 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0054.wav That at the end of the tunnel there was no light so 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0055.wav Ye a kinda gave up the fight 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0056.wav That's a terrible thing eleven years old feeling like you've been left out in the cold any trust ye hads 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0057.wav Porn hold not knowing on who you could rely when what you were told was so obviously a lie 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0058.wav It got to the stage 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0060.wav No i'm not proud that this is the case 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0062.wav But frankly anida give you at least a taste of what was going on at the time that for a while 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0063.wav I had lost my mind and had no idea as to how to find a way out of the hell that i found myself in 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0064.wav A genuinely thorp that through suicide 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0065.wav I could win back some points from those who had been my tormentors throughout each school year 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0066.wav That maybe i could make them shed just one teer in payment for all of those shed in the depths of my fear 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0070.wav I got a second chance a more time to think where i came to understand i could be a strongling 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0071.wav But i was lucky the next schoo 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0072.wav I went who had a teaching staff that actually knew about bullying and what to do should it appear within the student population 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0074.wav They noticed my hesitation and asked me for an explanation 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0076.wav It was at that school that i was inspired by english teachers to explore the fires of my creativity and even these poetic desires 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0077.wav From them the confidence i gained helped me in numerous ways to train to put my life within a frame of reference th t i could abide 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0078.wav Though there will always be a little part of me that is terrified of the depression i fell 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0080.wav And now try ang use it as a rock upon which thee stands knowing that my life is safe 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0081.wav Within these hands that having been through hell i can now withstand anything that is placed in front of me 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0082.wav My experiences have in fact helped me to see the positives in what could most likely be a very odd and interesting life 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0083.wav But amongther no illusions that itwoll be free of strife 
MSP-PODCAST_1659_0079_0084.wav Least now thou and prepared to roll te dice

MSP-PODCAST_1702_0262_0006.wav I didn't see this the whole time it went right by me cause you just didn't know 
MSP-PODCAST_1702_0262_0007.wav So that's why you have to do the research and see how the whole thing works and then you'll start to see how everything n in the realm is working ye

MSP-PODCAST_1908_1114.wav And of the word going around and i think that's very important because the internett is so big 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1116.wav Ale thers just the ton of information out there available and so for some one to put t altogether as fantastic 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1216.wav At's clevera i'm wadit had it hub culture start now this isn't like

MSP-PODCAST_1908_1242.wav Similar to what's happened with bic coin where it wasn't being taken seriously and now obviously through this gigantic conference corat in that way

MSP-PODCAST_1908_1724.wav At so to you're make it yre trying to keep that ananimity cause a wire 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1725.wav R transfer you gan have to go in there and they can lake see your idean obviously the bank sees who you are
