MSP-PODCAST_0627_0041.wav They are a pathology full stop but i also think it's frankly cruel to constantly apply moral condemnation to people unlucky enough to be borne 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0043.wav And you constantly sang we're disgusting and evil doesn't help 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0044.wav I have never salted anyone and i never will 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0045.wav I am a person extremely concerned with ethics and moral philosophy 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0047.wav Basically there is a certain group of people with a certain mental health problem who you seem to be telling to fukoff and die and that they are less than human 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0050.wav Ii certainly didn't tell this group to falk off and die that's why i had the whole interview exchanged with that gie 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0092.wav When you say you're not exclusive what you say it's like fifty fifty or you're more attractive to people your own age or 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0100.wav And when did you notice that this this was a thing like how old were you what was your response 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0176.wav So they will they will target the kids when they're in the situation to be able to mmu 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0196.wav So there's people far more open minded than me about it am i'm probably goain to get criticism from that from that direction 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0246.wav Just feed back you know e that's that's really how much i think that we need not be having these conversations so that at least people are al 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0248.wav Look at and what's causing these things think about that and try to address it 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0252.wav The point for me is this we absolutely can't 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0253.wav Normalize this kind of thing you know that i know that 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0254.wav But there has just been a huge scandal in the uket worm from in which hundreds of people have come out and said that they were abused by their football coaches when they were younger 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0255.wav That reminds me again that these things don't go away if we don't talk about them they get pushed into deeper and darker places 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0257.wav I can't answer those questions and iam sure there are also other darker questions with opposite results that would need to be answered when considering whether or not to do this 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0258.wav Another quote was of course it's right to treat them differently for something they didn't choose to the extent that they are dangerous yykes 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0259.wav And another one was society needs to learn how to draw distinction between a being attracted to children 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0260.wav And be molesting children one is involuntary the other is voluntary one is disturbing the other evil 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0262.wav But if suppressing that urge can actually help to protect children then that's clearly what we need to do 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0269.wav M i don't think i am in a place where i can have a completely clinical discussion about this do you o 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0274.wav But would you say that you suffer from depression or 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0279.wav You keep them talking about this as been pretty manageable for you so dy think that may 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0294.wav And that must be a hard thing to live with e sibai 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0295.wav Yes and braid 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0299.wav Right but what what would you recommend that like sipe 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0300.wav Ople come forth and tell the doctor whenever they have these really strong desires and compulsions to act on this 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0301.wav But we can't mandate anything then what do we do 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0313.wav It would scare me if they threw me in jail for searching these things definitely because i'm not a terrorist nor a petifile so 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0316.wav Jus trying to think of the ways that that could be a problem however 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0317.wav Am completely in favour of it as well because obviously this people that fit that profile due need to be 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0318.wav Paid a little more attention to 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0336.wav So if there's this it makes 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0340.wav And you often say that you know you're drinking or your a you're drunk or you've mentioned that you're nel 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0355.wav I completely understand im and i don't i pen thi's going to be a recurring theme 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0399.wav I into you so maybe that's the point they were trying to make but it was s really silly silly way to put it i 
MSP-PODCAST_0627_0423.wav Or something more explicit like just 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0015.wav Talked about howl how he might have the right and tent but he really doesn't he's not helping anything at all 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0019.wav No i no and i have been longing to see this distinction for so long like 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0108.wav Are you saying that you don't understand why that is or it shouldn't be like that or onoy ishould be able to celebrate white pride 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0152.wav And enac was talking about i think emigration in terms of race so he talked about how there was a white woman 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0200.wav So i think just stopping mussles from entering won't stop that ideology from spreading we've got to have something 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0222.wav To show them that it's okay to be gay i mean and this is perfectly compatible with our corriculum yet people freaked out 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0224.wav Back away but i don't know somehow when it's muslems they do 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0365.wav Then there's a large group that listens to you but then it's it's the same group how do we reach 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0481.wav Being trock load of trolls to dea a han after she did a new intervel ith beanycy saying that tem 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0630.wav And and it was it was brilliant tommy is also very carismatic and speaks very well and 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0637.wav It's like you know there's something up with that 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0695.wav Well i think that people are making the mistake of using the same scale as muslem extremes when i mean i completely disagree with this 
MSP-PODCAST_0631_0853.wav One di there's a kettere's another story of a german girl who made up a story about being raped by muslev iv a grand when she was't but what's all

MSP-PODCAST_0632_0104.wav Well how can you even be asked to take that gamble and how can you be asked to hope that he is lying about everything it's just a 
MSP-PODCAST_0632_0108.wav He he absolutely is but the people that love him are the ones that mock the the campust snow flakes which is 
MSP-PODCAST_0632_0140.wav And you know these other things are not not a big deal lut how can you turn your focuss away from islam if i'm criticising like the far right so they'd never understood me
