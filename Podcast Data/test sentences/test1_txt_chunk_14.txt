MSP-PODCAST_2055_1807.wav At at any time are i guss of youre listening to this 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0027.wav There's so much technology out there for 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0030.wav And dianss is this one part of one central crucial part a that underpins how the inernet works 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0034.wav So it's specifically the system that is responsible for converting webside domains like for example twitter datcon 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0056.wav O when somebody gives you your house address 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0066.wav So twitterdot calm ah may even 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0067.wav Ou know change the ipeadresses throughout the day based on load balancing or from where somebody is trying to contact twitter 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0078.wav Right ye and they're not hard coated they 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0083.wav Ut that doesn't mean that you have to you can ah go into your computer settings and change the dina servipiatres to 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0091.wav What a sort of the importance in the significance of discussing 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0092.wav They set in and at dianestov 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0100.wav Refuse to give you twitterzipiatris 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0105.wav But in not in all circumstances so i believe in 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0107.wav Where they were simply preventing their diana servers from telling people about twitter's actual ipiadresses but if people 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0140.wav This a sub feature of deanas chain called on block 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0143.wav The second big problem that can occur with vianiss that has nothing to do with censorship is simply security issues 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0145.wav They can the deona system can be used against them to 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0150.wav S well that every website that you visit you know 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0188.wav Iscussing in and periodically revisiting the a two concepts of inscription and authentication 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0192.wav And authentication is when you insure both the integrity of the data and that your 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0196.wav But i mig not know who that person is i might think there's somebody else and that's and that basically makes the conversation nots 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0197.wav Ecure so for a conversation actually be secure and 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0199.wav So but to go to the example where you are talking about a man in the middle 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0203.wav Is pretend to be twitter so you could have a server running somewhere 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0205.wav You could even be apassing traffic back and forth 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0208.wav Reading what's with the conversation you know you would be able to steal sebastians password and then hacken to his account 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0210.wav Ah into sebastians a version of twitterdat com that could also do verious malicious things and to 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0212.wav On the network in between sebastion and twitterdatcon 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0231.wav So i apologize if this gets a little to 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0233.wav Ah there are two kinds of cryptography 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0234.wav One is called symmetric cryptography and the other is kind a symmetric chryptography 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0246.wav You tell anybody ah any one who you want to be able to send you a message 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0253.wav A messages you want o send to twitter you can incript them with that key 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0254.wav D then send them to twitter 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0257.wav That's the basic idea 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0283.wav It says we're going to create 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0285.wav Public eys basically everybody on the innernet is going to trust these people 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0289.wav And so webbrowsers actually ship 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0296.wav He already known beforehand 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0297.wav And these two hundred organizations are so they can actually allow other organizations called intermediate 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0309.wav And they say and they're able to sign webside 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0311.wav Can go to a certificate authority 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0328.wav And without their knowledge sign is certificate in in terms of protecting yourself against ther different ways ta you can do that i believe si will 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0337.wav Well diinas so so this is something that we should make superclear which is that 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0339.wav Itit plays no rule is what i am trying to say 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0347.wav That's certificate so deanus doesn't play a roll there and in terms of vipienne 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0353.wav From the vipiene to the webbside it could be man in the middle 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0354.wav By a rogue a certificate 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0355.wav And hereis the crucial point that people need to understand 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0359.wav When you aggregate all of them and then when you aggregate all of the intermediate certificate 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0361.wav Ah according to some research that some people did you get a number that's over one thousand two hundred organizations 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0364.wav Most people a can't pronounce most of the names of the ci 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0371.wav To create a certificate that can be used to man in a middle any website on the entire internete 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0373.wav Antities that people have absolutely no reason to trust and hepeople are wondering haws this happened 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0436.wav And what it makes possible is ownership of digal information 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0438.wav Without relying on you know som 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0441.wav So i think youguis have mentioned that a your audience ha 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0447.wav Is effectively kind of how the name suggests a chain of blocks 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0449.wav And they are generated using this stid 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0453.wav Quet so you can think of a block chain as a s 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0456.wav Ecause in fact ther are third parties involved in the bitcoint block chain th 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0458.wav But these third parties called miners 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0460.wav Hat are difficult to pull off and ar detectable called fifty one per cent 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0463.wav In the block chain so if they start doing that that becomes a serious problem because if they can reverse enuff blocks 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0465.wav Ano thethey they kan for example in bitcoin 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0481.wav Which allowed people to create these transactions that included names 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0485.wav And that transaction is spread throughout the bit coin network or else are the name coinnetwork 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0490.wav And now nobody else can register it for some period of days 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0497.wav They can replace both of those systems that we just discussed putting in the ipiadris into that transaction replaces diones 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0516.wav Is kind of the same problem with bitcoin 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0520.wav And what we started out with with dones chan was doing something very simple 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0524.wav And the way we're going to secure it is we're going 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0532.wav This works fairly well but it doesn't work well for people who don't have that 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0539.wav At the response's match and that improves the security 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0541.wav And that's kind of like our future direction with this project 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0542.wav Is the development of something called thin client protocols 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0543.wav So this is something that bicoign has as well 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0546.wav Willbe wallet's that support something called esp v 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0556.wav And then a trusted proxy like dianestrin on the other end of the spectrum 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0561.wav Of a blockching so it's kind of you can think of it as short term memory 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0569.wav Well that het could work either way 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0572.wav A proto cal that the dioness chain service speaks or a proto cal that full nodes 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0601.wav To a key that theyon and then you suddenly lost your domainin 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0612.wav Is splitting up your identity 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0632.wav Ah blocshing world they can and sometimes do lose their identity into day's world as well 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0635.wav So it's possible to create a system where if gugel were to lose its keys 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0641.wav Ah so it's possible i'm fairly certain it's possible to reintroduce to day's existing system 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0648.wav Ah but but i'm guessing yo a't probably possible 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0659.wav Wer i think  on this t 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0661.wav A thet the are a company aanon profit that specializes in secure communication applications 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0663.wav Plications are theire actually signals on andredis two 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0674.wav Because for ill one of a are 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0675.wav Interests in name coin was developing a secure messenger 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0680.wav In a way that facebook could not read and you could do it in a way that didn't involve you messing with any key 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0681.wav The soft word would autimate all of that 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0683.wav Hat's because name coin 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0694.wav And then somehow verifyind make sure that you got the right publicky for that person and not a mistaken one 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0717.wav From a user experience point of view 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0724.wav Ig businesses enterprises that need to secure their systems in a way thats simple for them to manage 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0738.wav When she heard the name oke turtles and heard about the project a 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0768.wav We if if we end up supporting something that isn't beneficial 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0770.wav So that kind of that word beneficial 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0772.wav Thee systems are beneficial are you working full time on this anthis is there 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0779.wav Ah i started working on th n s chain back in two thousand thirteen 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0781.wav As part of my senior project 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0798.wav Well the next thing that the next spit thing coming is a crowd fund for work to to finances to be able to work 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0802.wav Its a very important piece of softer but now we 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0810.wav If if you are trusting a accompany to store your keys 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0811.wav For you you are making a huge mistake bec 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0813.wav The bigger accont the more successful accompany gets 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0816.wav R in in some sense how much security they throw at it 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0818.wav The bigger the pay off is for actually hacking them 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0822.wav Cure way and think clints are a great way to do that 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0830.wav I sent him a nemail shortly after reading that post asking if he needed help with it 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0831.wav And we exchanged a few emals and eventually i got distracted and kind of went off did some other things 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0834.wav Being pursued by a prosecutor coincidentally the same prosecutor who had pursued ah a close friend of mine john james 
MSP-PODCAST_2056_0852.wav Now please follow a ke turtles on twitter 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0068.wav Established legislated and operated programme for and entire country 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0081.wav So the safety net is not triggered it's always 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0082.wav Here the idea is that as long as the group has 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0085.wav It's up to the group to decide what that value is for example a grou 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0107.wav King and based on that 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0113.wav Because one of the reasons why a lot of people are here is because of tokins and criptocuran seent all of the other stuff and i notice just 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0128.wav A effectively at sure although there could still be bills that you might be paying the idea of basic income is 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0129.wav Just sort of the basics covering the basic it's not going to get you 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0216.wav Eople did survive those previous transitions i am sure a l 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0252.wav Ut i consider to be the correct way of writing softwor that interects with the innernet in a secure way 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0253.wav And so the work that i am doing with group income simply utilizes blachains because it deals with the internite 
MSP-PODCAST_2057_0259.wav Any criptocurrency and any feot system as well 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0002.wav Other goes com i 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0003.wav Now r mi won to clothes it just for a band with 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0011.wav A gregg is a long time colleague of mine and and he had some concerns about it so 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0013.wav Ah vis his ince more than a hundred forty character has given in the the in inuance of the stition of the 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0018.wav E new york agreement a also known as segwit to x and his also the spoken out in support of bit one forty eight in the past 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0019.wav On my personal opinion is that bit one forty eight and user acuated sophforks in general are not incompatible with the new york agreement 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0035.wav Picoin to therium et cetera and i kind of keep an eye on the whole space as a researcher and also a 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0036.wav Doing my own work in the area 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0040.wav S was about and when i looked a little bit closer at it 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0041.wav I realize that the the whole situaion 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0044.wav Antoli in favour of segut 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0045.wav Being adopted on vitcoin a on the block chain 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0049.wav About a d one forty eight is 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0057.wav Produced by cors s that's that's among te people that's a very important point because the entire way that bidqoin works 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0059.wav Of well what do we do when we change the actual protocol of vitqoin how do we improve 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0066.wav And we discuss them and talk 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0074.wav Repeat the same objection over and over if its no clearly been technically addressed an its considered a done matter 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0084.wav A letchista in a the users have the real power these 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0089.wav Created by the miner's not activating seguat and holding a the blockshain kind of a the vicran bloching a 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0091.wav Ah all that frustration can kin t be taken out i in the form of this use or assisted softfork 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0093.wav Ah you have to give plenty of time are you in dealing with the thirty billion dollar block chain ah for lots of different eyeballs to have a look at the problem 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0095.wav Severely harm the value of it am 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0102.wav Really should be thinking a theream ah for 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0105.wav Ih and i'm specifically referring to the replay attack that's sa 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0107.wav Is the replay attac ii've been talking for a 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0110.wav Thinksgregg o unjust a taking notes h 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0114.wav N of whole bunch of people ae so 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0115.wav We have the exchanges who are concerned about this we have the court developers who are concerned about this and we have ah 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0120.wav Three play attac ah i think i think it kind of a 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0121.wav Still 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0130.wav The basic idea is that 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0136.wav Tic and the that resulted in e therium othe hard forking a from the legacy chain and the legacy chain was renaimed to therim classic 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0152.wav Les but because these are narrower set of rules 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0160.wav That's one very important significant difference ah and these lead two two different kinds of 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0163.wav S called the wipe out attack and the other is called a replay attack 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0166.wav A the etherian community was very rush they had a dead line approaching basically when the attacker could withdraw the etherium that he had a 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0176.wav So one of the mistakes that 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0180.wav And due different sets of transactions on the two chains 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0188.wav Ot really screwed ah by this o there was the situation where people were 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0190.wav Selling ether and they were not splitting that ether from 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0193.wav A token what he means is and what is the replay attack so a replay tack is when you have two separate chains 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0198.wav I just red broadcastla and that's called the replayfac and the daoatacker was doing this throughout the entire thing 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0217.wav To day and the bipon forty eight situation the user assisted softfork 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0218.wav People are being told that 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0219.wav They have this power two 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0221.wav You know worried about the wipe out 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0222.wav Ack which is basicleno because we're dealing with a soft fork now and not a hard fork 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0227.wav So this effectively can create a new chain and the wipe out attack is when 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0238.wav R signaling in te thethe percentos the last thousand blocks or something like that to activate the soft fork and 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0248.wav Rs they're just going to be sitting there without 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0251.wav So ah a not only thin can become pletely worthless but ts g 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0254.wav You know the longer they're not getting into you are one forty eight chain the bigger 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0260.wav I though the wipe out situation is fairly e a attack is easy to understand 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0261.wav Abasically the legacy blot a chains going to continue on unless he yu get some miners on to the a one forty eight chain he may start making blocks 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0265.wav Mez and what not that can be done arm i j 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0269.wav I the legacy notes and the legacy clients ah 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0277.wav Am of block's mind and the other chain got that amount bless some more and all of a sudden this chain appeared on the network 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0279.wav Then everything that happened here would just be tossed out the window all 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0285.wav Ah being mirrored so that might not the wycout attack might actually not be that bad because if there's a replay attack going on the n 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0287.wav Ut ame let's focus now on the replay tacadee because that is the real problem with de ponfortie 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0292.wav Really ah they are basically the same thing they have the same transactions and the 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0298.wav Their not going to exist because for them to exist you have to have 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0305.wav With the same thing as going on it if you wanted to sell your legacy coins and buy these other coins that are here 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0313.wav If you were to sell you on forty eight coins 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0319.wav This brings us to the final sort of ar 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0322.wav All of the methods that i have seen for splitting coins 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0323.wav For a bicoin transactions a are not tenable i i'll mean two of them and and point out why they are not tenable 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0329.wav Send them to both chains and am 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0332.wav Ah and it's not something that users can do themselves because it's 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0335.wav At does this for you because that would kan defeat the purpose of b 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0340.wav So to make it trivial to do this is in of itself a problem 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0342.wav Because of that if people were storting to actually try to do this you would have adith 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0346.wav Plan so imagine you know people trying to do this and then 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0348.wav That might have additional a consequences ah that we haven't even played out yet a unknown consequences 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0352.wav Another method was recommended or not recommended but suggest 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0356.wav I kan be used i 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0364.wav Punch ability is a very important property that all bit coiners want and it's you know what it does is it says basically there 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0370.wav Splitting coins that actually is tenable and in that case you know bib pone forty eight might become a 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0373.wav Ah jimmi songs ou post where he makes a good point 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0379.wav In and repway protection 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0380.wav And he says here is the problem in order to offer such protection the for 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0392.wav Of how bit coin works what can happen all these replay attack things 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0404.wav An caus his is this is e this is an it this is oak 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0407.wav Oun and the second is 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0409.wav Reatened at all by one forty eight a because of the lack of replay to protection um 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0417.wav It's every other direction let's let us address that question 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0424.wav Ifty one per cent or more ore running the legacy chain 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0430.wav Fifty per cent then what that means is that it doesn't matter if they reject those blocks 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0432.wav Ame they would they would be rejecting all ah 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0442.wav We jus can have a copy of the legacy chant 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0471.wav Smaller chain going to be doing of of the of the economic nots like what is 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0482.wav As the the notes actually have the economic power 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0486.wav But it it's extreme to make a point 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0490.wav Pahajjust when you finishd the scenario for the stak of the 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0491.wav Otansica  im so like  basically at jso so there's a very 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0493.wav Forty eight or signaling for segwid and you've got literally every single other user of bit coin that's enforcing one 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0496.wav So so are you saying that it's leg opposite you have all the miners on the legacy chana and all of the users on on one forty eight 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0501.wav 's function i you cant like if some one tries to send a payment 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0514.wav Itson it 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0522.wav I can be ov trate trate for multiple reasons 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0532.wav Or you know i thether 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0536.wav Old to send a transaction to the actual bicoin network to like seoce this 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0553.wav They can seddenly bring a whole bunch of miners on mine and a 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0554.wav A running one forty eight noit notes and then a bring that number back down ah from ah you know sixty to like forty nine and then cause panic 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0564.wav Ius has to be based on hashbawer so for notininto niney 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0580.wav The idea is is that if you once seguet well 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0584.wav By mining my coin ah then they're going to start 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0587.wav I don't even think the price of itin will fall necessarily a fusor start buying lycoin i think that a 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0591.wav Gainin in a the percentage of the total cripped o currency market cap 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0593.wav That way and then o 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0624.wav As ah so i don't think the miners are threatened by it but them 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0636.wav He's not to be making as much as the other miners who are miking on that on that other chain and eventually a 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0638.wav Ethere the's upin a panry i 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0639.wav The the inventment he gets from a higher return on another currency kind of incentivizes him 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0656.wav To live broadcasts to a discuss this a gregg i'll be interested to hear 
MSP-PODCAST_2058_0658.wav To a share a a i like this on douvrida just pan me on twitter or something and we can

MSP-PODCAST_2198_0041.wav Of obsession i have not emerged from that 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0042.wav Because i keep finding new layers of depth to understand this

MSP-PODCAST_2198_0077.wav But it also has other consequences 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0078.wav We use money to express 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0079.wav And create social bonds and relationships

MSP-PODCAST_2198_0303.wav And you don't need to tell them why

MSP-PODCAST_2198_0317.wav Absolutely the sairing wheel was not invented until thirty years after the autobbile was introduced 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0318.wav Why because the first automobiles had two leather straps that you pulled left or right 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0321.wav That's called skiomorfic design

MSP-PODCAST_2198_0332.wav And yet it still happens all the time 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0334.wav L the time and so of course if you replicate custodial accounts exchanges that take other people's biccoin and concentrate it 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0337.wav Stop centraliing the decentralized currency 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0341.wav That exist because of the decentralization of control and power 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0344.wav If they all give their keys to one person or one organization

MSP-PODCAST_2198_0357.wav You're inviting the sharks bicon banks get hacked bi

MSP-PODCAST_2198_0403.wav You will hear a lot about block chain 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0414.wav But it's not the intrinette of money 
MSP-PODCAST_2198_0416.wav Everybody who asks the question gets a free copy of my book come and see me in the back fare think you so

MSP-PODCAST_2199_0017.wav Here this is the biggest 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0021.wav D i go around the world u and i talk about open block chains and cripto currencies people often have d 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0023.wav About this technology ight now in greece a lot of the interest 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0024.wav Is about how to find ways to invest 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0030.wav Unto night's talk is about the next bit 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0032.wav All the time which is what is going to be the next  bitcoin 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0057.wav Right unless they're compute of scientists you say algarithem they're like them 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0058.wav Be someone else at this party i could talk 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0061.wav If you say it was a very interesting like et ta decentialized system that allows you to create a monetary supply of deflationary acets that distributed in a fair ma 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0067.wav Because if you believe it works what ti 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0070.wav Ays what ar you going to do 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0071.wav You're in to sell everything you have and by this 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0072.wav Thing and then when it becomes a hundred times bigger you're rich you go home you retir 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0077.wav Right one of the most guarantee ways you know that this technology is in a bubble is when people you haven't seen since high school call you up like me 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0079.wav No catastra the 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0080.wav Remember me am is this a good time to buy 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0086.wav I'm beginning to think i should sell because if it's beginning to attract you're kind of people who had no interes 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0091.wav Can't tell within thirty minutes who the idiots at the poker table is 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0092.wav You're the idiots right so if you're like 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0103.wav Ge doesn't get band by the government or whatever announcement knowled 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0111.wav Am so the bottom line is knowledge an education is an investment you can make that will last 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0112.wav And even if biccoin ails the knowledge 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0113.wav And education you get from biccoin doesn't go away right but anytime i tell people 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0114.wav Lat they're like yow a yow cak am bo 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0122.wav Some one else what you should buy that means you don't understand the echknology well enough to make that decisi 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0125.wav Nciation good market fit 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0127.wav Ansom of the market the laquidity is there like if you understand all 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0144.wav Ouquet so i have known about bitquin for almost a year 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0145.wav And i was reading all of these scientific papers and i was trying to understand how it worked 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0148.wav Y to use it so in order to try to use it i mean it to ba 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0150.wav My comfort that that boy was i need to buy like 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0152.wav T to go to a grocery store 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0154.wav To transfer money and this is used mostly by poor people who don't have a bank account in order to pay their bills so 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0160.wav Japan which was the only exchange that existed for bicoin at the time 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0175.wav Ething that they think 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0176.wav Could work what do i mean by work 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0180.wav Itting it's got some people on the web page it's got some f 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0183.wav Looking for the next piccoinare going to believe this is the next icoiso what they d 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0184.wav O is they get into the market with a lot of money when the price is really early on then they wait for all of you to go il 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0187.wav Yahe that's exactly what's going to happen and that 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0188.wav System of investment is called pump and 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0189.wav Dump right so what they do is they put o money 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0198.wav And so as soon as lots of people who are not 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0203.wav Ump and what they do aes they sell all of their shickcoin 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0205.wav Ut they made a huge return on investment and all the people who put in a hundred herows justin case go 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0209.wav Then they repeat and so on and so forth 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0211.wav Ork and none of the people that were really involved in the early days believed that this was a good investment 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0212.wav They believed it was an interesting technology 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0214.wav You had to get some of it to try out 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0218.wav Right that's tho how t works 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0224.wav Later it goes from two dollars to eight dollars and i go ye 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0225.wav Scoore i quadrouple to my investment 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0229.wav And this keeps happening aget that this has happened to everybody who's got an involved because it's very easy to sing oh i 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0230.wav Uld understand immediately that this investment would go to light thousands of dollars but if you told me and 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0231.wav Enty twelve oh it's two dollars 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0232.wav Ow but in twenty nineteen it's going to be thirteen thousand dollars 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0236.wav To day in three years as going to be a hundred and fifty thousand dollars 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0242.wav Thinks they do that the strata 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0244.wav By low sell high in practice what you andopt doing is a somewhat similar strategy called by hi sell lo 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0245.wav We're what you do is when everybody gets excited you buy some 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0248.wav No done it 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0249.wav Right who hasn't ok really who 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0250.wav Asn't alkay five people very 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0251.wav Rd so the bottom line is that we're all looking for the 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0262.wav Everywhere right and then they're like all lets 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0264.wav Ose because if you do that and an 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0270.wav That's what is ging to do 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0271.wav Uin n you have a la a lot of 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0285.wav Ts so even if it manages to be very successf 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0288.wav Right and every time there's an opportunity for food a who 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0293.wav So what happened with becoi bi 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0296.wav Orterless in a pure ditital fort o kay that 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0298.wav So when some one comes and says we can do a slightly better bick qoin 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0299.wav Great you can do a slightly better bicoin no 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0305.wav You have shecor and it comes along as like where the next 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0308.wav S and has got enough diferentiation that if they both started out 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0309.wav It would win it would absolutely win if they both started out 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0310.wav At the same time it would win but now 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0312.wav Where the book says mastering bick coint where the sauceware libraries are from 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0313.wav Bicoin wire the exchanges have bicqoin and it has a lot of liquidity where there's tw 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0315.wav Where you can easily find people at the local star buk or some better coffee shop to trade 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0320.wav I don't have any and everybody i know is already interested in this other thing 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0324.wav Well then it's no longer occupying the same environmental nesh 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0331.wav En de one nobody attacks bea coin n 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0332.wav Da too nobody attacks bicqoin on da 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0333.wav One thousand seventy ffour nobody attacked b 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0334.wav Oy nobody had really heard of it no 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0335.wav Udy thought it would work on daytooh 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0336.wav Thousand five hundred nobody attacks baqoin r 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0338.wav Time it was strong enough to resist the attack 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0341.wav One they attack your system and the next morning it's gone 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0343.wav Get hockd you get crashed you go out and do proo 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0344.wav Of work i've got a new proof of work i'll grow them and everybody comes in with their gep hus 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0347.wav Ight so they have plenty of jupees 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0350.wav Right so then they dominate the network to their 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0351.wav Os your security ill i ah 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0354.wav It there's lots of them and the 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0356.wav So you saw proof of stake and who buys all the stake rich people 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0357.wav The only rason rich people didn't buy all of the biccoin in the beginning is because they thought it wasn't go to work but if you 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0359.wav M wooking for the next picquoin that they can sell to you 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0360.wav To the people who don't know any better 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0362.wav And i remember receiving the email 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0363.wav The vatolic sent out task for comments 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0366.wav 've got this new idea we're looking for deva 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0373.wav In his kitchen and he patiently explained to me that he had already tried to do it on biccoin 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0388.wav Then the interesting thing that happen is now if you talk to people who really into atherian alike we can do everything including what 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0390.wav An't no you can't but 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0395.wav Y money of the world application 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0398.wav But the funny thing that happens next is while etherian people alike we could be the next bictcoin some other people are going 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0402.wav Everyone in the theory was looking over their shoulder and gone who you 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0411.wav And finds enough attention 
MSP-PODCAST_2199_0422.wav That's not enough right not trump just called the strog dealers
