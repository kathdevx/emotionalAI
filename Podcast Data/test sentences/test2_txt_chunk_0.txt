MSP-PODCAST_1810_0072.wav Is i you kow i think it's a really valuable practice so in often in them 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0075.wav Ol or as school ever maybe do 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0081.wav About pricesses like that an he's some

MSP-PODCAST_1810_0125.wav Dote i understand what you mean o it's we've talked before about how 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0129.wav Interrogate their own practices wants there in placeming and i know i know 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0130.wav We've talked before about the tendency of schools to say things like a er formative assessment we did that five years ago or 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0132.wav Something you do so i i can appreciate 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0135.wav A matter of a matter of workplace culture or matter of a workpla 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0145.wav Ea business but really what i what what 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0146.wav My miser o think thoughts 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0148.wav O from that point of view i agree with him i think there's a lot of practices that we can look and learn from and see whether or not thy work in our contexts but my isshue 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0155.wav And looking outside looking at these practices one i see it's almost positioning the business world 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0161.wav An we should be looking to business o the 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0167.wav Am idea of bringing business solutions into education 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0168.wav Is the way it sort of radefines 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0185.wav Ande he repeated the mansure about money not really making a difference in education because you have to tagg at it properly in this no point in throwing money an ag 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0188.wav Any effect ize measurement on the difference that it makes for students who are working in a 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0190.wav Was that agiam pickley was talking about was that wu 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0192.wav Were the they could only if they couldn't run the a condition during the dacus that would am black out the school or something so the kids ar 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0196.wav Sider what it would be like for those students if they could actually be working in one of this cals which had working 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0203.wav Reader finding the rolls of what we do we redefining 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0218.wav Arguably their ability to engage in princ 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0221.wav How much do they actually serve the the purpose of formal education and can you take that principle can that principle 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0222.wav Till have the same benefit for schools if 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0225.wav Educational improvement that then you just look at success differently but then 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0226.wav Ost practices do they necessarily translate in the same way now the 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0232.wav That underlying a assumption of the practice that somehow it might help minimize cost or maximise product 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0238.wav It always has but it's now seen more than ever in terms of budget and in terms of cost verse reward and th 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0241.wav O was a good year you have to consider a in a educational out 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0244.wav Or are we by doing that importing that non educational purpose into the system 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0245.wav Which in many cases and i will you know until somebody proves wrong to me i'll happily de 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0251.wav To take an idea from a setting like business and find a way to make at work in education than 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0259.wav Swere ond not your schools but education si 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0260.wav Stoms were engaged in a much 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0262.wav So inyat's worth reading aron's plog if you haven't 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0263.wav Look at his blood before it's his weps at his rad right respondut com 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0264.wav And this particular article is called utelin education but am 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0271.wav R in relation to those ideas of in a short tem gain atsaving costs you've just reminded me 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0272.wav Of another article which i read yesterday 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0279.wav And i believe that's what what has been happening 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0280.wav Um is i think they've been chaning the suckled failing schools into academies 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0289.wav During their tanue but the reports is they fell by an average six per cent after they 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0292.wav Says in the report that results would dit nine per cent 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0293.wav If the super had left after three or more years at the school 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0294.wav Meanwhile they was this huge am 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0295.wav Expense because they then had to bring in consultancs to save the school after the results crash so she said a hundre 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0297.wav S schools haveng to pen more than one millionpounce h 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0298.wav Ah and thats outside the cost of the salary of the super 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0308.wav Pecentan ony studded to increase three years later 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0309.wav Um and there was a larger dipefelr in place for long 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0311.wav Ll dep after depatch was nine per cent 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0314.wav Ah it is the sustite schools with sustainable laders had slower growth but avoided those 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0325.wav Ome cases ye only at people who are effective leaders who are good at bringing people on board ets 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0327.wav I wonder how much of that effect is because 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0329.wav Cess and when they leave some of those things may stop that they are initiating but from what you are describing out of that article it does 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0330.wav Sound like there were a systemac or at least institutional changes made 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0334.wav D but raiced an evidence from statistic experts at education dartilabs suggest that some academies have higher than expected 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0335.wav People tern iver sar thereis more  nobete that their research 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0336.wav Of you slain am people want to have that verified 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0338.wav And we hear similar stories of chattar school models in the u s where they manifestive 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0339.wav Mag ina create good results through really questionable stratagies like this as well inof and quite 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0346.wav Their not going to basically abandon their obligation to educate every child 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0347.wav Ther surely a and no government could walk away from that but 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0352.wav At an event were we heard from a former superintendent of new orleans 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0353.wav In america she was talking about no we heard from somebody who had had experience in the new orleans sist 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0356.wav Es about how students from disadvantage backgrounds were be 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0357.wav Forced to travel two to three hours to a school that went p 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0359.wav To reject students so the nearest school these kids could get into 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0362.wav E only school that was willing to take some one like them was so far away that they weren't a part of their local communitiits just the potential forlongd 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0365.wav The details of the uca proposal arm beyond what we ought what i already know about the academies independently but 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0366.wav Itjust strikes me as 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0367.wav One of those sweeping cost cutting driven 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0376.wav Nt government body i am not exactly sure how it exists legally 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0377.wav But they will still keep their school of valuation and assessment body 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0379.wav Helps establish school curiculum an programmes across multipal school so its 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0391.wav But you know thet's all say 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0393.wav Have rally am 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0397.wav Um but have your management policy which it's very am 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0399.wav Mor extreme behaviours at all you know you see these pictures of kids 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0400.wav Walking in a single line on only you now they not allowed to walk by people absolutely no talking in the corridors it's its o 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0404.wav When we are talking about ringing business in you know this is another example where i don't know how these people 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0413.wav Has been fairly uniuniformly disastrous in terms of educational outcomes and this again goes back to what i was saying early about the profit motive and the 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0415.wav Possibly not being able to coexist because to make a profit in a school 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0422.wav I'm happy avein corrected i'l know i wouldn't be happy to be corrected on that but i'm 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0423.wav Illing to acknowledge i may be wrong am an 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0424.wav Its in the australian cont 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0425.wav Ext it's worth noting that we've had a bit of a brush with this discussion here in australia man we know that in western australia and queenslan 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0429.wav Ta christopher pine talking about the desire to make a large number of public scho 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0433.wav Eing up is the term they like to use they love to use language like freeing 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0436.wav To make them independent in some way so it this is not something alien to the australian context its its happening here n 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0437.wav Ow and in a given how contentious the debate around public education has been in australia for the last few years an men 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0438.wav Auguably since the introduction of nap 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0441.wav On the lookout would do have to be aware of these ingscoming and we particularly need to pay attention to the successos 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0443.wav They are startin  t demonstratei believeand i am happ 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0447.wav Ve come across all of the tales of genuine long term educational improvement w 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0450.wav Significant improvement everywhere that we have seen disadvantage addressed effectively has been a story of bringing schools bringing pa 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0455.wav Es greater accountability because ah 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0457.wav Schools so it's the governance of the school becomes more in 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0464.wav That need too demonstrate because they there theyr no longer it as closely 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0466.wav I think we should probably do an episide on this ccause i'd love to topmar 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0467.wav Ah but i know we've got a few other things to cover in this episide thiz 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0468.wav A whole huge 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0469.wav Am body of information about this i've got another ardicle about pesons quiss to cover the planet in company 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0472.wav Sure it might be really good to divote an episide to the topic 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0479.wav Yea good idea and hopefully we can get some content on that in h very near future 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0482.wav We've bumped him back a little bit by de fault but here he is 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0486.wav In schools one of e a 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0487.wav Tudies which i find particulary interesting is called the australian covert bullying prevalent study and that was conducted in two thousand and nine one of 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0492.wav It's less than half but it's it's close 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0494.wav But what's even more interesting about this is the rate at which kids 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0496.wav Those fifteen per cent a boys who are tha such a small percent 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0498.wav Who as seeking help the late models that approach adopted from the work from a bloke call michael tonnycliff and in short it stands for this so the owl stands for 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0501.wav Actively listen when ee to make sure that adults are fully engaged 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0507.wav It's not a big deal to start with we h 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0510.wav Ork with them the tea stands for 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0512.wav An deal with it rather than waiting for it to be given solutions when 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0517.wav Encouragement not only and that the kids have ou know they've done well first and foremost in coming to seek help encouraging them in terms of you know they can act 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0518.wav Upon the solution that they have come up with or their their 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0521.wav K about things how did things play out did it work did it not work 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0522.wav How might we and further impr 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0524.wav Hitzer several of my colleagues got bat to me said you know what it's just like coaching and you know 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0525.wav I think there's a lot to that that a coaching model is one in which whether yo're working with adults or working with kids 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0528.wav Go through in order to look at all the different options available to them look at challenge the realit 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0529.wav He challenges what really happening and then come up with various prorspective solutions 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0530.wav The point of the coachy model or even the late model is thatit that's not then the end point you make another appointment anothe 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0533.wav Strategy may well not end at working and i think this model whether it's a working with kids whether it's working 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0536.wav Grow model r the grosth model of coaching thit 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0537.wav Lots and lots of am resources and research out there that i think could really help you 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0538.wav And build the capacity not only of the young people in your organizations but all

MSP-PODCAST_1810_0663.wav Hindof communic it is luning si 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0673.wav So has the you indicated that this this definition as brought a concept of lintrosy is potentialya little bit contentious 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0674.wav Is this has this definition has this understanding of litrocy changed over 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0677.wav That the nesin question the lutricee itself 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0680.wav And thereave been a number of cando a seminal 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0682.wav What have you of reading wirh people 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0693.wav Computed soft ware and mybarphins 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0701.wav Then anything you do that in that works towards that end ols some kind of communicative function w 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0709.wav You've brought in this idea that literocy is primarily this communicative social 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0710.wav Meaning making experience but in order for people to be able to effectively communicate and engage in those literacy practices 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0712.wav Aramen it's my understanding that the the sorter back to basix argument we hear about litrosy 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0719.wav And if you look at the youm if yo look at the curriculum tat's exactly what it's telling 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0722.wav Where the bird argument can't of gets really blurry is what happens after that 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0727.wav And really effective kind of loving experiences for the children that thy have in their classering 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0731.wav En calwoi but 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0732.wav It's not particularly effect because a sort 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0733.wav Argud it to the mans of the actual students that of being taught that the contextest 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0736.wav Truth of the matter is as the catiencs do what means to be done for the kids that they've got 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0737.wav While while i would definitely like to get back later on in this interview to discussing some of those direct instruction programmes 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0743.wav Diages in schoolinghim and where does te teacher begin 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0744.wav Identifying and improving a student's electricy skills 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0746.wav E talk for the next six months and we still 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0750.wav Really a inadequate kind of superficial jump cury i would say the modest important first step 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0752.wav S is on the how olf reading and writing the nuts and bolt stoff 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0762.wav Ote of the actual stategies of the trying to do him on we wich ar 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0770.wav Well i just want to pick up on something you said there partic 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0775.wav Exposure to a primary literaty education is is fairly 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0776.wav Mitted but it seems as though skills in orysey ar something thati don't see coming into the discussion or that mar 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0777.wav But yet my understanding is that's a very foundation all 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0779.wav Sy and wondering where does oracy instruction fit in the bigger picture 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0783.wav Shall is the enormous importance of onanwish developman fortu 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0786.wav Ain community context the kind 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0789.wav A huge proportion of e straglinn students that come 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0792.wav Saw you there there is an assumption 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0795.wav We call emerging litrocy which often includes things like om being out of a recognized letters of the alchabed barbing ofo gus ane basic hanrinin a conoista 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0797.wav They talked about just how 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0816.wav Paused a moment when you brought in the idea of having assumed or required levels of litrocy before entering school is 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0817.wav There potentially a problem with what we set as standard expectations of lytrocy especial 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0819.wav I mean yes and at the fran ton it conol 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0824.wav Am and i guess o for me the issue becomes

MSP-PODCAST_1810_0846.wav H ah it's a pasthwork it's a pathology as litte 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0850.wav O those students coming in with a a lower than expected level of atrity are those direct instruction programmes what 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0852.wav Look like in the class room pade 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0862.wav Thats very different ah to it to an approach to teaching which see or anything else

MSP-PODCAST_1810_0874.wav Fective more effective for students a 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0875.wav On we often hear these this talk about comparative stats and literace rates and growth 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0895.wav I deracly 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0900.wav Opportunities to go off and try stuff out and 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0905.wav Ing with not only the need to teach our 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0906.wav Students literacy skills but are also then dealing with some of the broader pressures around the expectations of literacy instruct 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0907.wav Inimean what what youare describing here as we 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0910.wav Obstacles what are the challenges that are then potentially preventing that from happening as effectively as it can 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0914.wav Ammering school teachers stand most of their day sace the slace in front of their classering they am they don't 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0917.wav What are ther different kind of me 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0921.wav Rcy pall em interventions if you like but to the outeplan really targeted curiculum am you no experiences

MSP-PODCAST_1810_0969.wav Unitt that the problem his that we dine have 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0975.wav Well i suppose that goes back to what you said earlier about her also not pathologizing the 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0977.wav Gim with ber something to build on 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0986.wav And giving teachers the tools an the opportunity te be able to w

MSP-PODCAST_1810_0993.wav Is or has it amin hasn't always been that way to 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_0995.wav A couple of camps that that i guess 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1002.wav It didn't involve as much explicit taching of the building blocks of litricy and so ina 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1011.wav Rather than looking at what thee get your practice and and you trained in a particular way and you might have your belathes about how kidsagon a l

MSP-PODCAST_1810_1037.wav For about seven 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1038.wav Or at years by that stage on new south lales we had 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1042.wav Mandates and pride to that mandating ah 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1054.wav In't even think it's an issue is it cot o strong man when you have a debate about something that isn't actually happen 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1057.wav New south wales i mean obviously that we you ol continually improve our prac 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1058.wav Tises the other part of the argument de i her which is really frustrating as its

MSP-PODCAST_1810_1075.wav Using exclusively a whole language approach was abandoned and that you think that was a good thing and i suppose this goes to whatstuar 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1077.wav And with the whole debate around phonic's instruction is 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1080.wav Is necessary and teachers about the the relationship between characters and sounds and and blending them together to be helder pronounce words on th 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1084.wav While it may be nice and easy to think well if i can teach kids to pronounce these five phonic sounds to day 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1085.wav They've learned something valuable but if the students don't see a broader purpose in the context of their learning 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1089.wav But it always been my understanding that the the issues in the education debat 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1090.wav In general but particularly when it comes to litraty is the tendency to swing 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1095.wav Wrong rather than 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1105.wav A very attractive view to government 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1106.wav And to the newspapers it's much easier to 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1107.wav Think that things are simple and that we can solve them am 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1111.wav Ilbera really effective and desirable practices 
MSP-PODCAST_1810_1113.wav And i really come up with ye i an

MSP-PODCAST_1811_0000.wav You were listening to e on 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0013.wav You may remember that in november of two thousand eighteen 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0016.wav Of the world and of the future that they are going to inhabit 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0024.wav Thousand and seventeen brought a lump of coal into parliament and suggested that those people arguing 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0029.wav Ool he doesn't specifically say that they shouldn't participate in the protests but much 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0032.wav Ead perhaps is more important than the cclimate change issue that the students want to protest as part of these events now whether that is a genuine argum 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0033.wav Montonot is something only mistotian could actually tell us a i have 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0037.wav Pation in democratic processes 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0038.wav Now the australian curriculum has as part of its suite of hachesae subjects civics and 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0040.wav Here in new southwales where we like to do our own thing with curriculum that is slightly different from the rest of the country we 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0041.wav Hav civics and citizenship as 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0043.wav Meant to be imbedded into all subjects as a sort of focal point that comes up in every subject in every class room at a different point in time as r 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0046.wav As potentially participating in these student protests generally from what we saw in the media last year it 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0047.wav S students in the later years of high school who make up the bulk of the protest participants and so given that age group 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0049.wav In these protests and this is from the year a 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0050.wav Eght civics and citizenship cars 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0062.wav Vics and citizenship content at this level involves two strands civics and citizenship knowledge an n 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0071.wav Skills at this year level is provided by the following key questions what are the freedoms 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0075.wav Ut their freedoms freedom of assembly freedom of expression freedom to voica dissenting opinion 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0079.wav Cular political ideology this curiculum is expressly 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0080.wav Alling for students to be taught the mechanisms of politics as part of being an engaged citizen in australia and if you teach students what the mechanisms are 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0085.wav G freedom of speech association assembly religion and movement 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0091.wav Now i did say that here in new southwales we have our own 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0092.wav Take on that part of the australian curriculum and from the nusathwuale's curriculum website civics and citizenship is identified as one of thos 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0093.wav S cross curricular priorities which after going through 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0095.wav Ifics that says civics and citizenship content is incorporated across all new south wale syllabuses and includes principles and concepts under pinningd 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0096.wav Mocracy rights and responsibilities of citizens global citizenship and the influence of global events in australian democracy 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0099.wav So again we have a list of exp 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0102.wav So my point at the end of all this is whether or not you agree with the issue that the students are choosing to take action over if you adhere to 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0103.wav The required outcomes of australian curiculum or the criculum here in new south wales 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0124.wav In this interview we discuss some of the issues that face teaches engaging in social medio but also the 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0125.wav Idea of who speaks for teachers in social medio and the ways in which representations of teachers ar 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0126.wav Similar inddifferent to those of the traditional medeo net works 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0127.wav Joining me now from queensland is stewar riddle stewart thinks your time 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0138.wav Utus educational research and its impact on education an of 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0140.wav Personal experience an that i had myself a of her 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0144.wav And what in it up happeningwas i got caught up in this 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0147.wav Offence to the fact that i was resterring to myself as a tacher when 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0148.wav I was not employed in a school teach and i was working 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0153.wav This idea yet know what it is that we day 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0156.wav We cannor cannot say and say that was kind of the the ulterior motive for the book from my perspecti 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0157.wav Yet i i actually remember when that happened and and it certainly ha 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0159.wav You know we often hail social medirg an the intiniteers being about the democratization of information but theis also been it's also a loud 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0171.wav And the reil well but also very vitible 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0180.wav Ople did dit agree with them but in 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0187.wav Sicial media that ye have these 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0195.wav I think it was around two thousand and thirteen two thousand and fourteen that the pew research center in america did a study on particularly they were looking at sot of the american polit 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0196.wav Icle divide but just the behaviour of people on twitterin and found that even though twittar is sort of a public and open platform that everything 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0199.wav Ited to it before that the idea of democratization of information might be a bit more of a superficial reading than a reality and and in fact 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0200.wav We still create these highly concentrated echo chain 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0216.wav Essional networking an identity building ters an is extraordinary amount of policing of behaviour that goes on on twitar 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0219.wav Oblickly make statements about social issues on twida yeu 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0223.wav And who's listening and for what kind of what con o out comes do you get from speaking or communicating through the 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0225.wav Ocial medior because min the first thing id lector to clarify 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0226.wav When we talk about teacher voice wmen obviously ato at a constract that exists to be able to discuss it as 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0228.wav Icularly before social metior came along wher see teacher voice located i i gas if you i you go back t 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0232.wav An pudum in a pin a particular con of a 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0233.wav The simple oy too much but anyway 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0240.wav If you look at the literature on it 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0241.wav Ec despite the fact that folks o pain con of incour 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0242.wav Iging this this ar supporting old teachers 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0246.wav Years and very rarely well you see actual teachers being talked to you see a lot of teachers being talked about 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0260.wav Hen there are two really noitable outlies tu din't connect in to the rest of twida an 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0270.wav Lification and the fact that there was not one teacher or teach a body represented in the discussion panel having this conversation 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0274.wav Is represented in public conversation and policy making i think they're being left out as much as not more than ever before 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0275.wav And soy that was part of the problem that we were interested in in that particular chapter the weerite was or whoisit it actually gets to speak the teachers and how's a 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0277.wav Good som yet ie 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0288.wav Is john hattie now we'll know about john hattietre's visible ligting stuff blabe bot don't a talk about that what a 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0292.wav Ot arima anyway but say he is a guy who dot not have it or he has a 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0293.wav Ut ter accountbi's never twaited fon 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0302.wav Cin a stoff happing in anshy yet it was almost like this big haddy am aphon 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0304.wav He was being talked about a quite wank 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0305.wav He want an evolve in that conversation at all he wasn't there 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0306.wav He was not part of it despite the fact 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0308.wav I out i've seen i've seen a similar kind of phenomenon with them 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0309.wav Ken robinson in the yuka who also is not 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0311.wav Especially when he is yet aching publicly 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0317.wav Um have a walk down a lok mowereis quittes a much more gowardly ficing plattle hum 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0321.wav We dight have a very good understanding of just how problematic it can actually be rut 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0330.wav And say this thing is kind of like 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0341.wav Ught relationship that academi as had with journal publication for some time in other old 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0342.wav Publish or parish a mantra 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0350.wav Crazy things like napline happen we have a 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0354.wav Twenty thousand times and bababa where it where that becomes the con of the perverse 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0364.wav But in this particular instance 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0371.wav Still one of the top australian research papers thats been shared on line and so 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0374.wav You aren't the need to say of course all these people 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0390.wav The intention is to try and get try and get that attention and i i could name am education bloggers who do the exact same thing 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0395.wav E a selection by us thats pasicaly been haunting us for centuries 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0407.wav Idea of teach e voice am do you feel as though ultimately 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0408.wav Teacher contributions to education discussion about a positive effect or are they still largely just sort of screaming into avoid that that the hat one  yo ther thingan 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0410.wav Am the political context an 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0429.wav Anyway i just realize at thougt of doing a political rantile in a stop 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0432.wav Ans but thereis also quite a number of large a professional associations who also speak on behalf of teachers who are notably absent you know 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0433.wav The only i think here in newsouthwyles the only 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0441.wav As is main well 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0452.wav M of course exaggerating slarly um 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0454.wav The papeters are you have a voice within these discourses 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0463.wav Ah fairly you know a fairly lokey and how they used t it ar in turms of their teacher identity am and so ii guess is youre prove ou 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0464.wav To a whole cavia to everything else theyng sthinking about 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0467.wav Inds of position making and sidetaking that happens in a very 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0474.wav Talk about problems am and certainly i would say me personally 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0479.wav Ye i just wanted to kin of make a clear on talk 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0483.wav Ranted none stop about twide being am a dangerous'n an 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0488.wav Other folk i do think it has the potential for it am 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0489.wav I just i think we need to be much more you ans in our understanding o how twid a 
MSP-PODCAST_1811_0490.wav Oth constrains and enables us as

MSP-PODCAST_1812_0012.wav H episodes one of which was a recording of teachmeat in 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0013.wav Gauge the event we held as part 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0015.wav T was held in brismon there's been a lot going on in the 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0019.wav Look it was a a really interesting way of running a conference very am 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0020.wav Democratic i suppose its the word so usually when you attend a conference 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0021.wav There's a line up of well known and lessen ang canote speakers that you might go and s 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0023.wav Presenting to you but educat 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0025.wav Summer how if she was on a pragramme a few of h saids ago 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0026.wav She kept talking about how it would be harnessing the collective genius in the room and i wasn't really sure what any of that meant 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0028.wav I almost as am 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0030.wav Ege in their contexts and some of them a 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0033.wav What they did to try and include and involve parents more in the education of their children at a primary school she was working in 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0035.wav Large scale  project so stacy quincewhuser principle ino selfoas was talking about 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0036.wav The mentoring of new scame tachers in her own school but then notso 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0037.wav Ringing  that good practice across he system so she had a whole system's focus and yes it was a a real diversity of presentations 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0040.wav Nic i wanted to really 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0053.wav Ahaud of students i think some twelve students who were able to give a perspector from their their experience as a student so i thought it was really cleverly done the way that they 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0054.wav Gathered such a rage of the spectres to really add value to the different types of projects that people were working on 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0055.wav So then if you were dissecting or if the crowd of attendays were dissecting the presented problems 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0058.wav Ing a iu not hearing how othe people are 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0061.wav And soth in every one in that room probably would have been exposed to some ideas that resinated with their contect 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0064.wav Andthen there's others that dint am 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0069.wav I wasn't able to attain because i endid up fr am 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0070.wav Not being terribly well and and spending most of the dayin the hishell rom i but 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0071.wav Thy head there they were doing a number of workshops 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0079.wav Am refine their ideas and one part of that that i liked was that they included this panel of expert wiwho were high school students so that they could pitch the 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0081.wav So it sounds like it its a conference model really based around harnessing that networking element that people often says that the biggest benefit of of large events would you say that was is that 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0084.wav So ivery interesting the idea of more explicitly incorporating that ta collaboration and networking into conference events so 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0087.wav Im cabrn you've got some big changes coming up can you tell us what's been happening for you in the last few weeks 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0091.wav Replaces their old medea officer and the person that used to be in charge of publications 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0095.wav To put yourself out there in front of a group of munin three hundred are representatives of the teachers of the teaching profession and 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0097.wav L down and well deserved i i you what does the rule 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0101.wav Acts foregetting press releases out and whenever we choose to have any kind of a you know statement going out to the public 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0102.wav So it'll be a bit of a learning curve and i think part of the roll will be um 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0103.wav I think part of the roll will be figuring out exactly how all these these duties will go together in a new roll but i'll be very much looking 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0107.wav Thing that i've done a little bit of but not as much as 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0108.wav I possibly would have liked before i got into teaching and something on very ecited to be getting into  cammen inissence i cam an amazing opportunity as wel 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0111.wav O you and an no sir i think it's gotte really help ast with that 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0112.wav Odcasto because you'll distpel littl bet closer to some of the information that were often try to get through newspapers another sources yes and all i guess 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0117.wav Am especially as we expect that there may and i would say hopefully will be some significant changes to the federal education a gender 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0118.wav Over the coming weeks and months now for those listening who may not be aware on monday the 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0119.wav Fourteenth of september the then australian prom minister tony abbot faced a leadership challenge that was 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0122.wav Ninth prime minister now mister turnball is known to hold much more socially progressive views than mister abbots a usual hard right polit 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0123.wav Ics so we ar gan have to wait and see if this has any impact 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0129.wav Time of this recording there seems to be a strong expectation 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0131.wav E my slight clay that he'll be the new mnt 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0133.wav Ation portfolio although there's been some speculation that it couldgo to simon birmingham 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0134.wav Who served as the assistant minister for education and training under christophepine 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0139.wav However on september sixteenth the australian reported that f d regulation was one of the policies expected to be dumped by the turneball government with bannie glover the chairmen of 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0140.wav Universities australia quoted as saying that it was unlikely a new education minister woild promogah the same legislation 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0144.wav An the city morning herald reported that new south wales's education minister adrian pickaly had stated his intention to immediately begin lobbying the new prime minister to commit to the final two years 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0146.wav A minister pickely a nationals member reinforced the message that reginal and rural schools were among those that would gain the greatest benefit from a needs based funding model 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0154.wav When tembel made his first speeches as ame prime minister wil prim minister elect at that point 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0164.wav Very dangerous thing i suppose because it can only lead to disappointment so i guess i 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0167.wav Still probably be some time before all of the various various policy decisions are either 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0168.wav Confirmed or retracted 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0171.wav The person who has been rumoured to be the replacement minister for educatio 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0178.wav Places so i'd be quite 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0180.wav Well that might be a suitable time then 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0183.wav Ils teaches federation have all past motions 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0186.wav And distancing themselves 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0190.wav Of new appointments many of whom are are quite controversal because they don't necessarily c 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0191.wav M from what you might call strong educational backgrounds 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0194.wav Who actually represents public education in any way is michel brunages who is 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0198.wav Dy chair is a great proponent of direct in 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0200.wav Instruction a you know the commercial scripture direct instructing courses that geshan rolled out around the place and 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0205.wav Of academic research a lot of evidence around the place a lot of teacher testimony that would tell you that those approaches are not going to be e most effective so 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0206.wav Got john fleming with gotriv of fletcher 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0207.wav Ho wein i from yoself 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0209.wav Was he was he the deputy direct to general 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0211.wav Very confontational relationship with with principles and he is also napmau 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0214.wav Who it was a formar am catholic education director i think i can't remember his exact 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0215.wav I am de deputy director of the mobun catholic education office and a two thousand aight article on him that i found showed me that amongst the catholic education sa to he 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0216.wav Or his appointment was very alarming when he was put into be their deputy 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0218.wav Ants he also didn't understand the church relationships and church policy with schools 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0219.wav And he was strongly identified with the liberal pardin he is a former 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0220.wav Nother former liberal paddy staffer 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0223.wav A of public education on a budget paper that came out om a few years ago 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0224.wav Which the  grain piper has am 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0227.wav Parents am and possibly charged them to send their children to public schools that was one of 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0228.wav The suggestions in in the paper that she came up with a and she's al so constantly writing ardicles talking about 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0234.wav But it is to me quite troubling because they seem to be 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0236.wav To be am i think a number of em 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0241.wav Consend with what they migt come out with in future but i certainly haven't seen a then coming out with a hollot of materials that are promoting their very 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0243.wav No though i suppose the biggest immediate 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0245.wav Ah an i suppose any future draughts or changes to those standards ah we would need to be weary of 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0247.wav E know that after this after christophor pine first became 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0248.wav Inister for education they talked a lot about wanting to get rid of so called lefty influence from the curriculan from teaching and the standards do talk about 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0254.wav Clarify i don't have an issue with people who hold these particular views on education being 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0258.wav Atient but the difficulty that i am 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0259.wav A i have with the current board is that it as the union's the sangon is not representative bits not only not repres 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0261.wav It denies any elected representatives from teachers and that is why the union representative from the a 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0264.wav A profession have had no voice in select 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0265.wav Ing these people so i think it's really important that that we do have elected representatives on 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0266.wav Board such as this but also that the 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0272.wav Yes but i think also 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0277.wav Because and it's just worth remembering that christopapine actually wrote to the a 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0287.wav Cease any co operation with atsel and its work and 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0288.wav We can only hope that under the new structure this is something that gets some repaired rather than a divide that gets further 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0289.wav Separated cameron i'd like to think there'd be a change but 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0293.wav By the prime minister to represent aboriginal people of australia and while yes the council 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0297.wav So that just seems to be the ther mode of 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0298.wav Aparason yes well i suppose this is what we wait to see about the new front bench and the new prime ministers approach to things i mean 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0303.wav But as with so many things in politics and educa 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0304.wav Tion we will just have to watch this space 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0305.wav In the final story that we wanted to talk about for this episode 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0307.wav And that was relating to the proposed changes for the national curriculum as most of our listers would be aware 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0311.wav And on friday the eighteenth of september are potentially minister pine's last working day as education minister 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0312.wav A press release came out from the minister's office s 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0316.wav A it again mentions in par 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0325.wav This announcement has been made before any significant changes have happened but of course 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0338.wav The labour government the national criculum was developed through a hugely consultative process that took some time so it will be interesting to see 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0345.wav Into their teaching priogrames especially ane things that are quite specific like hiding 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0347.wav Teachers yesterday when tha news came out im youare really looking forard too getting a holddevert em bing abete stud implementing iwith the schools 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0348.wav Yes and antichnology an educatio 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0349.wav In certainly is an area a venble 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0350.wav S discussion and debate and hopefully in a future and not too far away episode will also be able to unpack that o i c d report that 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0351.wav Was published recently about the role of tychknowlodgy and education but that 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0352.wav Is for another episode aonce again when it comes to 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0353.wav Uriculum it looks like we are we back in the position of of waiting to see what final documents are produced at a national level and we will be looking to 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0355.wav So with a lot of political change in the air affecting education a 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0358.wav Odes but for now we are going to take a quick break and return with our main feature for this episode an interview with bruce burnet and joe lampett from queensland universit 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0364.wav Stratagy you'd like to share as part of the teacher's brains trust or if you would like to leave comments or fee back on one of our episodes then please 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0372.wav O please enjoy this episode's main feature 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0374.wav Thousand a nine they have been co odinating the national exceptional teachers for disadvantage schools programme which aims 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0379.wav All parts of australian education are a trialling strategies to better meet the needs of disadvantage students 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0383.wav Nett and joe lampett from the queensland university of technology 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0384.wav Joining me now from the queen'sland university of technology our associate professor bruce banett and a 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0399.wav Camnern if we can we're very careful to differentiate what we do from the bale discussion around 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0401.wav We're selecting them on their graves half way through so that means that the gpie reare talking about is how they've been doing in an education course so that in 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0404.wav Eyad done on one clack already how well there a 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0405.wav Ov theare tutors think they're doing in an education course how well they're doing as future 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0406.wav Eatures so we are really nought at all connected with how te 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0407.wav Ate done when a to get into their education tgreen a 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0413.wav I say so when you talk about giving them specialized training to work in disadvantage schools what exact 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0421.wav Lowisee as schools and for many of the 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0427.wav M you were setting out to solve in the development of this particular teaching programme 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0429.wav There were others of course as well why 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0430.wav Er  is an issue of distribution so we n 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0432.wav High achieving graduates and education faculties round the contry in adout teaching in a leadin ming suberabsore independent school so part 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0434.wav Anted the best teacher is the most a the hiatiin teachers to go to the schools that needed 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0441.wav In two thousand an elivin we've had four graduating co 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0451.wav Isusenarios in either state in a city state schools or independent schools now out that figure has drunk to around about thirty per cent 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0458.wav Queen'sland what 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0460.wav N or have you seen any impact in terms of the actual uno 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0462.wav Our first fridrets from the programme are now in ge third year of teaching 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0463.wav And you know we've conducted lulots lossof in to buse with principles and school personaland theire doing it session 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0470.wav Ly good there are sospols for instance 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0472.wav Ah previous to our pegraduates being the missifal at all for 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0477.wav Is the associated cost in terms of especially when compared to what might be considered traditional teacher training pathways how 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0478.wav Does this programme compare in terms of what it costs to give teachers thes specialized training 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0483.wav Der ria but bruce can talk about some of the more anewal 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0490.wav To great so that that staes the same and they just do that wise be ar inity like 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0492.wav I say in the other question i suppose that it often goes along with the cost one is 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0494.wav Act on student results comes up and while it may be too early to be able to talk about concrete evidence of student improvement what sort of time 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0495.wav Frame you looking at running this programme before you can start to 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0496.wav C whether or not that specialized training is having an impact 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0505.wav Intestud in learning outcomes he could determine and arrange you 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0506.wav Other braries um but what we are what we are saying and it is too early to answer to the anter it that we've only been out to any 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0509.wav Stud letting outcome movement im a obs of ni natiunal pitchmy dis nhowever 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0512.wav Andens and landagief in espects ah 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0513.wav Ayar doing it in such deway that they been noticed ndthey been no 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0530.wav A peted surprise to us that it's done that we ben addor to and attract the interest as well as te support an across a a a aa 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0532.wav Ill we i don have a gall and ain't gall eepin abut an i in also in evr 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0534.wav Asan for stample our way very comfortable with were it's sitting at the mamen 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0536.wav Fair enough but to ask the question of growth from a slightly different perspective then i mean 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0537.wav If over a log enough period of time you are able to demonstrate that this targeted specialized instruction is as effective as you hope it might be or even 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0540.wav That's a good question an we get ask that quite regularly so in some respects we would 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0546.wav Always like to remain a rutikue and special aws because it is quite labor and tenso part of the reason we 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0547.wav Our progrand works is because ah we were really closely with our students 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0550.wav So there are two ances to bat in the way 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0551.wav Wi ther are clearly they're clearly i race fos iprecations in siying um 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0554.wav Ple that there are many other great teachers that go through the system batthis particular programme 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0556.wav Ites itself from a lot of other proggrams is that around i is purely bot that at the letl performance of these particular students ah je splap i an 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0558.wav In a we helpd tosilitate the prices of anidling en to secure i women 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0560.wav Ah yet we know from historic an dartothe 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0561.wav Much of the riggen wringing 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0562.wav Tems of implummet opportunity is in fact and i inni 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0566.wav A at university or during practical so 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0569.wav Well another implication of the bigger isn't necessarily better question than is 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0572.wav Ved e processas that beang and also tied to that how do y 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0576.wav Ah did the prigramary ran the programme under the rei dou with in an existing vechelar vechelor education prie 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0578.wav There were no real resource implications 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0583.wav Dispate these thas particular safhit a a in in aucusties different 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0587.wav Ere are clearly in professions down the trap for im i want i that funn y can cenn cont 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0588.wav Tinue but we would hope that each of the institutions in some way and i'll be different wise each of them a very different models that the sien cool and oddel but they aren't landi 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0589.wav In different wiys each of those institutions we had the 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0590.wav That will either secure fom me and from other sources or even better still 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0596.wav Uits how have you found that process in different states in australia n if you 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0601.wav Salove a we are exploring as wi a  as we state now 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0604.wav Hoa im  is i wish in all the stites that it's much more constrained and on in your arm youself wells carrs 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0608.wav We there was a lowecy a school schooling section they actively channel if you like that us graduates to way they were nated u and that aniwld o 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0618.wav Think that we would at to see it disappear and become another thing that was tried end en ou knote and then disappeared after 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0620.wav Of sustainability really is the most important issue 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0622.wav Is on wit andi and if aire o one agrees its so really prue 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0624.wav I suppose what we would like to see mostas for that to become nor as we been say all along pour business with him faculties for us it's what ere our pass 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0625.wav Is it's the only kind of teacher education we've been wanting to do when 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0626.wav What we do know also as a consequence of worker in this area for a number of years is how much interna ashmol an exci 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0633.wav Fuld as crucial for instance as iknoliteracy is a part  every education faculty or mass or a sign 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0634.wav Or whatever it is me think that thought ye know 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0635.wav At in the end that probably is our goal is to make sure that ah 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0638.wav Couple of years for those who might be interested in learning a bit more is in 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0641.wav Inated fair faculty si profess 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0642.wav Or banett professor lampett thank you very much or your time and and best of luck with the future of the programme 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0647.wav Tion but in this particular programme 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0650.wav Teaching but that also seems to have a genuine chance of making a difference for the students with the greatest need

MSP-PODCAST_1812_0667.wav Onventional teacher training programms that we see in australia is that what theyre doing here is really recognizing that 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0668.wav Disadvantaged schools of schools with disadvantage students have particular naves that nade very high intensity contextually appropriate training 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0669.wav To be able turt to thrive an to be able to support student straight away 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0671.wav Rest of their cohort but then those students will end up in vastly different contexts and as bruce 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0672.wav And joe was saying in that interview what they are finding is they are able to get students who come from more traditionally affluent well off leafy green kind of parts of queen'sland 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0673.wav To actually find a place and an feel engaged working in these disadvan 
MSP-PODCAST_1812_0680.wav Saying that it has similar success as

MSP-PODCAST_1812_0706.wav Sought for with ardil and attended to with diligence 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0014.wav Merbile thones in schools have been a somewhat controversial issue ever 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0017.wav Risdictions and with different outcomes depending on who you talk to and what you're using is eumetrics for success 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0018.wav The city of new york became one of the first districts to implement 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0019.wav A widespread policy of baning mobalphones in schools and that was in two thousand and fi 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0020.wav Ive which is nearly two years before the first iphe 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0021.wav En even hit the markets now that band lasted approximately ten years before it was ended for a number of reasons 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0023.wav Ng mobalphones in all schools allowing students only in their senior years to have access to mobal devices in schools 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0025.wav Ous and and itaine the government held a review into marbal de vasses 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0028.wav Other measures to restrict and minimise potential distractions and bullying issues to do with mabalphones and then this year 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0029.wav Ng two thousand and nineteen the victorian state government have announced they're going to have a state wide ban 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0031.wav S now these policies are not without controversy themsel 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0032.wav Ls there are people with strong arguments on both sides foreignd against policies of banning one of the major arguments that gets presented against a policy of banning mabalthones 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0034.wav Eni that's been led out of the bottle it's pa 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0037.wav And that may be the best approach is to educate 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0038.wav Students in its appropriate use not necessarily just man access to it in the place where they are supposed to be doing most of their 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0039.wav Learning and social development on the other hand schools are 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0041.wav Ly among students but also between adults and students and even in some cases between teachers and students 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0042.wav Nawhere in australia one of the leading voices in favour of banning mobalthones in schools is 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0046.wav Y so i took the opportunity to speak with doctor cargreg 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0048.wav Or as the main drivers behind a policy ban 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0053.wav I great thank you very much or your time 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0057.wav Age which recommended a ban of mobalphones in primary schools and also recently the victorian government have announced a complete man in primary and high schools of mobalphones 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0058.wav Which you spoken in favour of 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0060.wav Why do you think a ban is the most appropriate policy for dealing with technologiane schools 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0063.wav Is talking about taking away access to the infinite by lat typs or am chaplet devices or crime books 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0064.wav Aso it's not really about 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0066.wav It is clea from a nitatuas qua 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0079.wav Thy report better academic results 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0115.wav Im i am perfectly entitled iam too 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0118.wav O with young people and accessing mabalthones why is the most appro 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0124.wav Who have medical or psychological problems i nai ivarfinds to have that does lot of flexibility in this pia in in this policy it is wrong to character 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0142.wav Well you've also tapped into another thing i've seen raised in response to these policies of bands in schools and that is that i there is this issue of it sort of 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0143.wav The having a disproportionate effect but for people in different socia economic a groupings within society 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0144.wav For example even if that the fee is paid for not 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0146.wav My understanding is also that that was one of the a issues r 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0149.wav You does the policy how does the policy account for are some of those social economic differences even just to use the example you raised before not all schools and not or 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0150.wav Munities might even be able to have individual student lockers tor phones at schools to help enforce the ban 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0151.wav Yew i'm in our rase that with a minister of education in victorian i said the clek jigaro expekitsta 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0152.wav Put their finds an lockers yact provide scols with locke 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0153.wav To there's an intera struct yor spend there ye can't have o cake and eat it tho om 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0157.wav Am local store iners a dollar of day to store their fines and the kids were walking out of the school and making fine cal 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0164.wav Arms some victorian schools have adopted this qolity the problem we have is that there isn't a good 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0165.wav Evidence faith for any of these four models of secondary school use am which is why in my report to  mi satoell 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0172.wav So how distinct is cibe bullying from some of the traditional forms that still caused problems in school communities 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0173.wav Ell at's twenty four seven it doesn't go away it's got a multiplya a sect i'm a lot more people say it and are a witness to it 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0180.wav Time period what would you see as the metrics for success of a school ban policy 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0184.wav An an emprovement in academic performance all of which 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0190.wav Urisdictions and not others across australia 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0193.wav For laws could change very very quickly 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0203.wav Technology is there a need for some sort of transitional programme to make sure that students get that education whuld you have a proposal for 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0209.wav Cherishies do it am and we need to get that i across the country quainesland 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0211.wav As ther go to sider safety frame work 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0216.wav Ah but your absolutely correct education will always be the most important underpenning of creading great cibe fit o 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0224.wav Ocus on banning mobile phone devices not 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0228.wav He did cites some legal cases where schools have been held accountable 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0230.wav Because the students were primarily in contact in that school context 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0235.wav Citizenship however it will be interesting to check out the course that doctor michael 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0237.wav Bal tacknolodgy in the course of both thei education and their daily lives with six months to go until the statewy 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0239.wav Uss and around this interestingly enough there hasn't been as much discussion in new south wales 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0240.wav Artly because in primary schools ob 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0242.wav Once a band is imposed upon high school students we will probably 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0245.wav If you are in a school that either has a tempted a policy of banning phones for high schools or if you ar in a school that ta 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0246.wav K in another proactive approach to education and management of mobal devices for students p 
MSP-PODCAST_1813_0249.wav O carry on this discussion and look at the experiences of schools that of both attempted bands and also looked tat other approaches to digil

MSP-PODCAST_1814_0012.wav Opefully be back with us for a next episode in a fortnight's time recently i have been 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0014.wav I purchased myself not books ihave been 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0017.wav Drew spicer they are both business studies ac 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0022.wav S to day but also something in a think a lot of people in schools can relate to at the heart of functional stupidity is the idea 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0023.wav A of this this strange paradox that institutions 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0024.wav Nd obviously their talking about businesses but that institutions 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0026.wav People and then often tell them to do routine work that does not ask them to engage the very intellect for which they were hired 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0028.wav Empowering and inspirational and then you get into a school 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0033.wav Thing else i found that a really a helpful guide forbid of self reflection thinking 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0034.wav About some of the practices that i might engage in regularly just on a personal level if not 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0035.wav Necessarily in the work place 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0037.wav May be need to be reconsidered for their actual impact as opposed to their perceived impact 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0038.wav As i said however id that book 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0040.wav An a reasonable way through is called a beginner's guide to the mantle of the expert a transformative approach to education 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0043.wav That gives a very easy to understand an access guide to this teaching method 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0044.wav It you could argue it has aa slightly greater application towards 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0046.wav Early high school years but it is a roll playing approach to teaching that puts children in the position of being an expert in a field and getting to rol play 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0052.wav I purchase myself i'm not plugging ot the people's products for for money or for fri 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0053.wav E but if you're looking for something interesting to provoke some new ideas in the classroom i 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0054.wav Think i can recommend that one quite syfley because i'm finding it quite a riveting raid myself 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0057.wav And it relates to recent reports of professor dian halpern's presentation to the australian psychological society congress 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0059.wav Tralia we have a long history of single sex education in parts of our education 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0062.wav That are girls only or boys only it's a practice that has different levels of integration a 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0068.wav Ode a benefits particularly for girls education they were not consistent and that they varied from from location 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0070.wav Awed over all the practice did not show any significant benefits but 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0076.wav Coeducational comprehensive schools that that advantage that educational improvement was a factor of the fact that more affluent families tend to sen 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0078.wav Our most elete private schools are almost all single sex schools 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0080.wav Families that are affluent that a wealthy that have a that have a higher level of education and those are factors that we that are fairly well acknowledged now i don't think 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0084.wav Ant of your long term educational outcome while schools do play a 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0085.wav Big part and teaching does play a big part in helping achieve that potential we still have not yet 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0094.wav Ies there are a lot of people who will have gone to an old boy schooler an oll girl school and have a particular identificat 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0096.wav Is a lot of a lot of sense of belonging often in incultures 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0097.wav That are segregated because you have to justify the segregation and in reading 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0101.wav Rhetoric which while valid though it may be in the personal context isn't actually useful in evaluating a whole section or ho 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0104.wav Because this one report or this one person has has said that there is no impact 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0107.wav Sode is it's an example of of one of those practices in education that are implemented sometimes unquestioningly 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0111.wav You would fight a wave of tradition and conservatism about the identity of the school 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0112.wav Just as much as you may be fighting then against any actual academic arguments or social 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0115.wav Tied up in the issue of single sex education 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0118.wav S of their failure to achieve the kind of gr 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0120.wav Ls but also the potential ar negative psycholog 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0135.wav Do we still want to live in a world where we separate and segregate by sex 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0136.wav And secondly do we want to be in a society where tradition 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0139.wav It's a problem that we've seen crop up with a number of major educational practices and 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0144.wav Yet they were embraced they were carried on potentially out of a sense of tradition and there are stories out there of potent 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0146.wav Nolgh based on segregation segregating students according to lea 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0147.wav Nning styles because of the absence of the critical avaluation of the implementation of those practices 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0148.wav So again to get back to the question of tolerating potentially negative unintended consequences for the sake of tradition 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0149.wav It's an aspect of the education debate that doesn't come up 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0155.wav What message does that send to those students about their individual value 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0157.wav Those pricess are bit ridiculous but 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0167.wav Der the the unintended consequences of what may be well intentioned educational practices 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0170.wav X education if you have a transgendor student in a single sex school 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0172.wav Does a single sex school have a right to reject a student who identifies with the genda but is not of the biological sex 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0174.wav More to the point what social pressures does it potentially put on that young person who is uncertain of their agend 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0176.wav And again regardless of whether a student is is transgender or not 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0179.wav But as professor halpern says also potentially a sterio typical view of genda 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0185.wav Erm negative consequences being effectively evaluated and having those practices considered in that context 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0189.wav Hippop to engage kids from all walks of life but it was primarily his work with kids at risk or 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0191.wav Sort of pique my interest and sare i too a find out a little bit more about how he work 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0195.wav Because it takes place in a in a school you will hear some of the telltele sahons 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0196.wav Ort of the school bell goes off o think in the middle of it 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0197.wav But itjust give you a little bit of an insight as to a some of the work that that he's doing not only in the states but 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0199.wav N off campus one of the ideas i had was i were a catch up with people are found interesting hera 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0200.wav Mped into on my travels and the not got round to do in it until now sitting with me right now is the doctor elliot

MSP-PODCAST_1814_0213.wav Ah and deliver content i think in a more effective engaging dynamic and interesting way ah biou know 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0214.wav Were also trying to empower young people as a autonomis creators and an artists really taking on that at that as an identity  andam and 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0215.wav Trying to be as effective as they can in expressing themselves so there's a l 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0218.wav Intervention 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0222.wav Very much based on  medio by 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0223.wav Portraal sensationalism and lack of a fact meeded 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0228.wav Fn and stop gangviolence amongst warring a gangs that were thereout a necessity to protect themselves and give themselves some kind of resources right 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0234.wav Ou now what it through battles so it's it really is co 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0236.wav To empower themselves ethenselves a voice an 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0243.wav Day is a lack of commudident lack of connection and relationships in ability to relate and hippop offers a vessel for that where folks can connect young people can connect discover themselve

MSP-PODCAST_1814_0324.wav Oaches what sort of experiences doth actually include and 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0325.wav What is it that makes them toxic 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0329.wav And the preparing teachers there's a group of folks at work 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0331.wav Every thursday and every school they sit by the phone and wait for to ring and know whether sunbody's coming by nex 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0334.wav Just to see if all of thee can fruits and vegetables or lined up a properly 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0335.wav I really becomes an anti professional culture and mind set quite often 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0338.wav Rup have are based on what's going to be inspect 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0340.wav Is level traye job than a profession so it actually demeans the 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0341.wav Life blood of what it means to be in a classroom if you came to my class wont o 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0348.wav It's hard to believe withoug it was that the reality those that 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0353.wav Real issues facing lots of school so the intent is we've got a get teaching right 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0359.wav Fashion then tellingstines what to do and badguring 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0361.wav Eproaches is it actually blames teachers for being in the most complex situations and reward teachers who happen to be by the luck of where they got a job in schools were 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0363.wav More than anything else so for those working in situations that actually need 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0365.wav Can create  a much more rigid direct instruction approach 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0369.wav So that's the component of it that the intent is we've got school struggling to get every kid to be successful and we can't afford that any longer in society but it comes 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0373.wav Top down approach what are some of the systems that are doing teacher valuation more effectively w 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0374.wav There's a variety of approaches around the world and sometimes their success could be just 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0375.wav Dumb luck so remember some of the bottles that are used that seem to be failing and onsucceeding the countries themselves may not know so finlin has been touted for many years as a 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0377.wav For a few years it' gone down a bit cu i hard 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0382.wav They didn't get into the smart fond business they 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0387.wav Fimlan doesn't have national tests 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0402.wav Ven't taken sort of a retrograte approach to say it's failed us now let's go back 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0403.wav Ckand whatever basics were while they are actually going forward in a new a new way that doesn't seem to have the punitive nature to it at all 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0407.wav Lls or have pitfall is an not perfec 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0409.wav Leave keeping teachers fresh in content and petagogy is the best pay off so they haven't put in any penalties they just continue 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0410.wav Too and vestin teachers new learning 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0411.wav And with some of the best results in the world 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0412.wav So as a contrast that's a diff just a whole different philosophy of what the profession of teaching is and how we teap teachers fresh and excited every day to do wuch riht 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0425.wav Leed teacher a creditation as an example and you can also become a highly accomplished teacher those career 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0427.wav Ofessionalize teaching and also connect professional developments so that 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0428.wav Ot one off sessions people go to and don't necessarily use it real

MSP-PODCAST_1814_0660.wav We know that dey want of euni

MSP-PODCAST_1814_0678.wav Concern is whose left out of that that actually would be great teachers and what right do we have 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0679.wav As a free society to tell them their dream is off at age seventeen or eighteen or a 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0681.wav In a use that the badge of high quality and

MSP-PODCAST_1814_0696.wav Read his valit the approaches to bolts on tests a beginning or end actually won't change very much a because i think it's not about the real issue of is actually the curriculum 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0703.wav Sa good way but i would use it as unmultibl options app 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0706.wav For time but it also means you couldn't have a bad run somewhere in high school or if your midcareer or maturage coming 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0707.wav T back you couldn't really have a opportunity to show that if you'd been out of school for a while so what if you have run your own 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0710.wav Ool and had started your own business they hd all the stuff but you didn't o hov to show that since your a tar or your h s c or your other admission's requirements wern't what they needed to be 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0711.wav What if you could show a university your porfolio which showed not only literacy and numersy but really the other skills that are needed your ability to write

MSP-PODCAST_1814_0747.wav What that will actually involve do you have any initial assessments or expectations of the path that that seems to be going down 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0753.wav I think it'll continue to evolve very positively 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0754.wav The piece i'm worried about is the infaltration of this inspectorate model for schools and schools of educatio 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0756.wav You'll see that what is done is actually stifle any form of creativity and innovation 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0758.wav Almost ruined of the excitement enthusiasm for learning though i think it's not a model we would want o do much with and maybe will
