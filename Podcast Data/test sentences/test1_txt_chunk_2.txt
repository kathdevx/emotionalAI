MSP-PODCAST_0202_0049.wav Ia curiousity it's sounds like your background has almost nothing to do with this sort of financial services industry and your talking 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0050.wav Very much like you've got technical knowledge olbosy now having come out the other end you would have learned a low but back at the start 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0051.wav Yu you were lake you said o solicitor and and was at farmersey or your your skill base how does that turn into 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0052.wav It was they like a ah some sort of vam like you said the universe opened a door well you just thinking you know what this sounds like fun i'm going to jump on board this business was thats 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0054.wav Think it's because you know having a cofounder who had the experience in the financial services industry and 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0055.wav What i could bring to it was all of the support other than ou no e i could bring to the business everything outside of you know the technic 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0056.wav Ol am aspects of it and you know even to this day as i have always employed different staff members i do believe that the technical skill set is 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0057.wav The easiest thing to recruit for and i've never recruited people based purely on you know having done the tasks 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0058.wav In in the past i think you recruit for attitude and aptitude and am intelligence and am willingness too 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0059.wav Roll up your slaves an and bunkar in and i think  that's what i present that's what i brought along to the patten ship 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0060.wav Oke so what were the interms of the growingnes company say you've got these agreements in place and you said you were getting clients and you said it was mostly from 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0061.wav Relationship so were you to before you expanded was it just you two on the ground or did you hire a team straight away from the beginning i hatted the c 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0063.wav No the company initially grew just through people we knew in property development and it was really my cofounder diver and i 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0064.wav Was about us hitting the pavement together hmand going out and i'm selling the drayman you know putting yourself out there and saying 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0065.wav Listen whatat we do business together and you know i had a career previously in pharmacitical sale so i understood 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0066.wav About the ned to close and ask for business and my business partner david is exceptional syles person and am 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0067.wav So that is what we did we hid up our network and we found a couple of k players and a k refera point and nurchred them 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0069.wav Uqe now was there something that was a pointed deferentiation for what you were doing because i'm assuming you now you were entering the crowded market space 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0070.wav There was only seven agents for g e australlia wide at the time and it was a booming market 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0071.wav O it was when the markret was really the property market was really taking off and just going balistic and there was lots of 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0072.wav Construction and lots of development certainly where we were in am melbourn at the time so 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0073.wav It was it was it was a very good market to be in because there weren't many players and it wasn't like home londs with deposit bonds 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0074.wav T was very difficult to be able to get the pen from the underriter and be able to issue bonds and there was a very good margin in it 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0075.wav O case so i don't want to say it was easy but it must have been ther i somewhat nice to be 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0076.wav We no trailing a blaze through a a market where  know you could knock on doors and not have some one be saturated with a 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0077.wav Ther people trying to sell them the same thing that's sir 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0088.wav Yes so with the deposit bonds ar people would make property purchasers and they wou 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0090.wav Twenty four months later they come back to us and they say what do i do now with this deposit bond because i'm i need to sett 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0092.wav So that's where we started getting into the home lending sart of things and my business partner david he had a 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0094.wav A mortgage manager at the time and that's the step into lending 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0095.wav O k so what did you personally start doing at this stage did you change rolls from sort of yon knocking on doors and an selling to something else 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0096.wav Look i became the underwriter for a long period of time so i got caught in the detail of underwriting the bonds because 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0097.wav Yes we'd go out together to pitch the case initially but then you know some one actually has to underright 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0108.wav Ahira a a tect firm to build a complete on line platform for you that's i'm assuming design to bring clients who need loans 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0110.wav It's actually just like your clients we just built a webside and we told the story on our webside and we got smart about how we got eyebl 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0114.wav It was about understanding how to get ie balls to our sight and then once we got eye balls to our siht it was about how do we convert that business 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0115.wav Nd have those conversations with people who want to engage with us so that they then want to you know fully convert into a lone application and 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0118.wav Writ city can star homelone finder help me choose inphor choice this was a sort of early sort of around those early 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0123.wav Aloan so that we could qualify for canstaffarstour wratings and because we qualified si for those wratings and also be 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0124.wav As our price was so sharp because we didn't have branches we didn't disseminate our products by u mortgage brokers we just simply offered them dir 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0126.wav The financial comparison sits would rank us and it gave the perception i think to many people coming to those financial comparisons i 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0127.wav Mus lack a thid potty indulsement from thes coparison soxs 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0128.wav Ric say you really leveriged a that train towards using comparison sha 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0130.wav That brought you a lot of your audiences is it fair to say that most of your initial online business came from from that comparison sites 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0131.wav Yes absolutely it did and am it continued that way for a very very long time and a you know it served us well that strategy 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0132.wav Now i'm curious for anyone who's listening into this because comparison shopping is something that's becoming common and a lot of i 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0133.wav Stries is there any tricks you can share with us on how to rank well in those sorts of things is te jest the case of having a lowest price or 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0134.wav Like you said getting yourself the the the right kind of brap badge ifcredibility tyounto to get to make yure people choose you 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0135.wav I think it's important to establish relationships an also consistency a lot of these comparison sacts really a pr 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0139.wav Comparison siht but it also they could be relying on us to deliver consistency which is what they wanted to be showing to their 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0145.wav They'r very well known so we were a challenge o brand and being this challenge a you know be yunder dok if you like we had to position ourselves that way 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0146.wav A and i think it resunated with a lot of people you know a really difficult time was during the j f s you know when the j 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0148.wav Iddety all of that was was difficult they were applyers arm that were pulling out of the market we had to get really lane and man 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0155.wav I can still imagine it would have been there in challeging its i was challenging to go up to against such large companies but pyou take us forward highty with the stake custodians then so you 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0160.wav It is we maght sure we developed abroade content strategy and you know this is were it is really important to 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0162.wav Arrison sights because new competitors were coming into the market so a big part of our play was to look for 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0163.wav And invester so that we could expand beyond just being able to you know 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0165.wav When we sold the majority ownership in the business an in two thousand an eleven what was appealing for that is it allowed us to 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0167.wav Lios in the podcrafts and we would be really looking at that point in becoming an expert positioning putting out the content so that we could 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0169.wav Googlanelydics an you saw where did people come from a you know that they came from all over 
MSP-PODCAST_0202_0170.wav Houqu so you became a a content marketing

MSP-PODCAST_0202_0173.wav Say on what your comment was i think having the personality in the brand worked really well though because yet's your rig
