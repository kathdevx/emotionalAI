MSP-PODCAST_1909_0709.wav They have an kind of impossible choice between 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0710.wav I'm either refunding you with the funds coming out of the funds that were actually being used to fulfil the project 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0711.wav Or to not refund you and you're unhappy about that because you're stuck with the situation that you don't like and you have no options 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0712.wav O if you introduce tokens into this and you say all right 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0713.wav You've paid me for this thing i'm giving you back a token that represents 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0718.wav Retail i might even get better than retail if it's something that is limited in supply 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0719.wav Um and most importantly it doesn't come out of the project rights so the project doesn't have a change in the amount of money that they have available to do it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0720.wav Cause what can happen is that a you can't effectuvely get like a run on the bank kind a situation where 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0721.wav Somebody asks for refund they get a refund other people see that they got a refund and they want to get a refun too because 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0722.wav Y see athey're being offered now and it's available and the projects can effectively run out of money because they start giving refuns in this kind of a a l 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0723.wav Icas had run on the on the bank sort of way 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0724.wav So that was the pitch that we mane om it funded well 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0726.wav The project we were talking about didn't actually matter that much on the majority of the money that we got came from the fact that people 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0727.wav Knew me and had you know listened to me for a long time and our biggest abackers by far were people whom i had personal relationships with going back so you no 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0728.wav Ack to the fature was great in terms of being a vehicle for us to ought to do the fund rais but i really did 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0730.wav The project was secondary to the fact that people just wanted to invest in what we were working on etokenly 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0731.wav So we funned it i was very successful am anda 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0732.wav And we started hiring up ah we brought the team up from a three people 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0733.wav Ah which was a myself a and my two cofounders a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0734.wav A devon and a nich am a mituco founders are developers they both 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0735.wav Went full time on the project u and we brought in two business development people two people on the 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0737.wav Artistic aside and two developers 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0738.wav Um so from there we basically went through and overhauled all 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0742.wav Om and at the same time we were doing this we were doing meetings with crowdfunning platforms and we were just kind of investigating the space and figuring out where 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0743.wav E actually saw the opportunities in the near term 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0744.wav And what we discovered once we started sending business development people into these meetings was that nobody wanted to be first 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0745.wav And that everybody liked the ideas it eveready thought that you know there were 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0749.wav T a lot of people who wanted to actually be the first to try this thing out and kind of encur all of these unknowns 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0751.wav Ame time were quoting on a bunch of different projects and were just 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0752.wav Ind of digging in as deeply as we could to different use cases 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0758.wav They nit away to sell their tokens and ead all this other stuff o wu 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0759.wav S build that and people put stuff into it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0763.wav But again you had this disconnect between the people who are interested in it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0764.wav First is the people who could create real useful valuable businessis with it and we just inereally see it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0766.wav R of last year om we essentially settled on one of the use cases that we had been working towards that was a more specific version of crowd funding 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0767.wav Nd the idea here was that rather than trying to create just another crowd funding platform that basely looked like other crowd funding platforms but had 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0768.wav T this kind of token element to it that was a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0769.wav Defrentiating factor instead we would 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0770.wav Create on a service ata music streaming service basically targeted towards artists that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0771.wav Also had crowd funding built into it in this way and 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0772.wav At used tokens to represent crowd funning rewards 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0773.wav Those crowd fighting rewards were actually the reward 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0774.wav So the product is called tokendorerphem 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0775.wav Am a tokendati fam is basily a reinvention of a you 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0776.wav Kind of like the radio form at ah with the idea that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0778.wav Rather than you know putting their music on to every platform out there and having some one by it on itunes and then have it not be transferible or convertible into something unspodify 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0781.wav Atform but also eventually on these other platforms as well 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0782.wav And so on that allows you to do kind of all these things you ou effectively get the ability to create 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0783.wav Iam like a ar like a physical c d 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0787.wav Um its limited like a physical object is it can only be created a ino in an official 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0788.wav Capacity by the person so it has kind of all the desirable characteristics of something physical b 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0789.wav Ut it's entirely in the hands of the artist 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0791.wav How much it's sold for they control the monatization and kind of all these other things 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0792.wav Tat's kind of the short version of where we've come so we started focused on crowd funding we found that crowd funning platforms themselves had the problem of nobody wating to be f 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0794.wav Ling our own not a crowd funting platform 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0795.wav But an application that makes tokens valuable that then has crowd funding built into it a kind of a baselayer 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0809.wav Tail is inegration by the bigs in the short term really it's just 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0810.wav So the tocandotofim application is a very spodify li 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0811.wav Ike application let you have playlists and lets you have kind of other value in handso features too like their chap rooms and things 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0812.wav Wore if you own an artists fan token than they can also create a chap room that grant's access viothat 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0813.wav Aswe built a front end because there were no front ends um and the back end actually uses the alexandria 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0814.wav Ject i am not sure ifa you or your listeners are familiar with t 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0815.wav At but on you've heard of these different types of content chains that are out there that are essentially fore putting the medadata of content 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0817.wav Am abasically 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0818.wav Ah the idea here is that you can create a distributed directory of content medadata that lives on a block chain 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0819.wav The cool part about that is that if you put the medadata on to a block chain then anybody who looks at that block jhane can see the medadata 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0820.wav And so if you have tokens tha represent licences and those tokens are on a block chain and you have some other way to determine that those represent licences th 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0821.wav And anything that looks at that block chain can then repar a recognize those licences without taking custody of 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0822.wav Them right that's the nice part is that the person still retains 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0824.wav H this person really does actually have this so what tokenly does is 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0825.wav M we make it so that rather than having to look at the block chain which we found a lot of resistance too 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0826.wav Im instead you just inegrate or eihtp a and it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0827.wav Does kind of everything i'm so when you're actually uploading music to tocendatefam 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0828.wav You're uploading it to the florin coin block chain that's where the medadata is going and it's stored long form there right so all f your monatization all of your owners 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0829.wav Hip informat s actually store long form in the aflo 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0830.wav Incoin blockchain and then the files themselves are hosted on interplanetary file system 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0832.wav Rmissioned napstertype of thing to be perfectly honest with you where i'm having the token that represents the license a enables you to engage i 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0833.wav Nut pure to pure network with ther people who actually own the license 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0834.wav Oh it's a really cool thing where we can take the nabster model 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0835.wav An apply these licenses to it cause there doesn't need to be a platform that's managing the licenses 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0837.wav That seems an interesting sor of niche application that certain arist may want to adopt whatever a 'm looking at the the the 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0864.wav Ya uh so that's a totally am good point and it's something we ran into to and this is something that actually is the case with 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0865.wav Verything when it comes to a criptocurrency and token applications is that like these neprocoffects are huge on there are meaningful pr 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0866.wav Oblems kind of withal of the stuff andpeople are used to subscriptions and 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0867.wav Scriptions are terrible when it comes to cripto currency it's a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0873.wav But honestly i doesn't have a lot to do with the platforms it does 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0875.wav Make these agreements if you ook it like spotify 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0878.wav Ough there is a bit of exclusivity that happens there 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0879.wav Ah so regarding subscription models i tolalleg 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0880.wav Ee with you we have had such a time trying to figureout how to price this in a way that actually make sense and what we've come to 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0881.wav Is what we call a play as you go monall i 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0883.wav And you get enough credits a within our system 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0885.wav Uh you get enough credits within our system to play i believe it's about seventeen hours 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0886.wav I'm worth of a music that you don't own i'm using the credits and then if you want to buy more credits then it cost about a two and a half cents 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0887.wav Pur tsong you on't play twice can you get t plampam i play them twice i'm in this paper i'll listen model and then if 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0888.wav You actually own the token that corresponds with something they need want to pay anythingit's 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0890.wav So we do actually have both of these models and the reason why we went with the subscription model was both because of useor behavior 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0891.wav And because we've stopped being purists 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0892.wav Hai've stopped being a purist about all of the stuff and i've now come to the conclusion that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0893.wav It makes waymore sense to create something that people don't have to use criptocurrency at all for in order for them to uscriptive currency 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0894.wav And so that's that's really where we've gone with this product is that if you don't have criptol currency if you don't have a wallet 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0898.wav S and you can still get the benefit of them 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0899.wav Ven if you are only using credit cards and have no wallet and stuff like that so that's 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0900.wav I think that as partly because of the way that we've approached this problem and partly because of the problem that we are approaching that we are able to do that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0901.wav But it is our pretty firm belief that most of the users who are gong to be using this product are not going to be people 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0903.wav Something that'll kind of happen because it's so and then as far as wy some one would want to use the platform 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0904.wav Ah the basic reason is that we are a going after artists through a couple of different channels ah with the argument 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0905.wav That on this enables the direct connection that basically 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0906.wav Every artist we've ever talked to  has said that they want it with their fan ba 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0907.wav Se both for communication for monatization for other things 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0909.wav O the way that most musicians work as far as getting their work on to other people's platforms 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0910.wav Um is by using companies that effectively u 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0911.wav Pay them u nol like fifty bucks a year or ten dollars an oblum or something like that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0912.wav And they go to the hundred and fifty biggest platforms out there and they put your music on to everything 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0915.wav That some one will pick a platform and then that's the platform that they use when you go there to find 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0917.wav Ause it' so fragmented so we don't really have to convince people that our service is the best and it's better than spotify we 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0920.wav En our system actually pays twenty times better per stream for the artist 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0921.wav U ah that they do and so there is actually rather large and centive for them to do it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0922.wav So that's a thing it's like the seven dollar per month fee you'r right 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0923.wav Ike that's with paying the artists a twenty t 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0924.wav Ime is better than spodify does if we warn't pain the artist twenty times better than spodify 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0926.wav Re but we think that it's really an important part of the value proposition 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0927.wav To basely won't return to do us create this platform in such a way so that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0942.wav We think that that's importance a we talk about those as experiences 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0943.wav S which has become sort of a buzzward in  the space a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0945.wav Periences unique personalized experiences thinks like the so you have so 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0946.wav Um the tokened out of fam platform ties together withar o ecommerce platform which is called toc 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0947.wav Markets um that allows for people to create 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0948.wav Om different types of you know events and different types of a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0951.wav Like on face book except the artist is actually the one that gets the pay as opposed to 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0953.wav Deep permission systems the other thing that's really 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0956.wav The platform and the front end is just there because 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0957.wav L we need a front end to kind to show off all the stuff we're doing on the back end 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0958.wav Um but where we really see this going is both to 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0959.wav Tist's websites so the artist doesn't necessarily have to 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0961.wav If hem they can just have them on their webside and because of the way the content licensing is handled it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0962.wav S not handled at theplatform level its handle 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0963.wav The use your level right with tokens so 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0966.wav Ans they can still do the paid streaming and the artist can actual make money y running their own basically little streaming service there for people who want t interact with them on 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0967.wav R website the other side of it is applications on you very rarely or never see a u like a band a come out with their own bran 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0968.wav D id streaming application uman if you do they're huge because again the licenses are held at the application level 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0971.wav Wehave separated the licenses from theplatform 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0972.wav So now an artist can build the applica 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0974.wav Nt ah it can have all their music in it high lighted up front and all that stuff but a person can 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0976.wav Know their their other licenses and just basically enjoy their music collection through this application even though 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0978.wav Backer whatever doesn't actually have any metallic licenses right so long as they've both issued tokens that represent these 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0979.wav Things than they work in each other's application simply because there's no forgibility 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0991.wav Well but i mean i think that's the thing is that in this type of paradime you d 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0992.wav On't need to convince people that your music is the music to listen to you need t just say 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0994.wav T's the thing that that like it's like em people talk about game tokens ah 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0995.wav Ans like say all blizzard is a good ilno they t 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0996.wav Ey they have all these games sor i don't be so good for them to connect them together but 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0997.wav Blizzard actually has the least incentive out of anybody because they already have a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0998.wav Atform that connects their games together without using an extra layer so what they get from it is really 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0999.wav Much much less than if you were to say take 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_1000.wav Ten different indies studios out there that each have one game 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_1001.wav And connect them together all now thy've got something's really valuble 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_1003.wav Hat they can play together they can have ineroperability so that so that so what you see is that it's not that there is no advantage for people who are already bi 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_1005.wav So it's a level playing field in that somebody who's independent and small 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_1006.wav Has all of the same advantages and opportunities that somebody already has who is big that doesn't take away the advantage from the guila's big but it does 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0001.wav By the project or perline of code 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0003.wav For less than a dollar create a customized diginal token on the bitcoin block chain 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0004.wav Hich you control and a issue it will and which allows you to know with one hundred 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0005.wav Rcent certainty that any one who has your token must have gotten it from you or some one who first got it from you 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0006.wav Because otherwise it provably could not exist 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0012.wav Which can be given to friends swapped or saved as the purchaser sees fit and 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0013.wav Ventualy redeem  yur webside in place of other payments and in compliance with the rules you 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0016.wav Let's stark bitquin podcast which the last time i did a conference which was about 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0017.wav Maybeeighteen months ago a lot of people had heard of i'm curious if that's still the cas 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0019.wav Ogay grate thank you everybody 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0021.wav In january o twenty ut so i founded the letsloctiquin podcast to explore the ideas people and projects b 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0023.wav And dab ye so it's hard to give this talk because 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0024.wav Like i said i haven't done a conference in the last eighteen months and that's been because i fell down a rabbit hole and wound up turning from a journalist 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0025.wav Into somebody who's actually starting a company running one of these things and a trying to bring some of these interesting innovations that i saw as possibilities into reality because 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0026.wav Wasn't happening fast enough tokens and cripto currency 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0027.wav Iriga tokens and criptocurrency are like apples and oranges they'are both frui 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0028.wav But with different characteristics both cripto currencies and tokens use block chai 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0032.wav In contrast an unlimited number of tokens issued by different people can use a block chain as a use a block chain like bitcoin 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0036.wav While something like bitcoin is valuable because it literally is how you pay the post 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0037.wav Age to send things on the bitcoin network w 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0038.wav Ut i generically call tokens can't be used to pay that fee and so for a token to be valuable 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0039.wav It must be something there must be something about it that makes it desirable or useful 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0042.wav N which n be hel by users in a single walled 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0044.wav Basically enjoying all the advantages of a blockchain and none of the cost 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0047.wav While the technology is there to do just about anything with a token 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0048.wav These possibilities are restricted by legal systems around the world 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0049.wav Just to get our term straight a currency token is something that has no value except that which the market gives it 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0050.wav An inequity type token is anything that looks walks or quacks like a token sold to those who want to i 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0051.wav Asively investing in something anexpecting a return 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0053.wav So it'sreally less about the technology and what we can do with it and more about who gets to decide what we do with it and whether those being 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0054.wav Disrupted or willing to give permission to those doing the disruptice 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0055.wav By contrast noncurrency uses of tokens are not trying to do anything the governments or regulatory bodies care about too much 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0057.wav Without much of the drama that seems unavoidable when presenting a revolutionary alternative to globel financial systems 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0059.wav Once purchase the merchant doesn't need to worry about who they owe the product to 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0060.wav They only need to make sure that they fulfil their side of the bargain whit 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0062.wav This means that a token can trade hands dozens or even hundreds of times without the merchant knowing and yet they can trust that if a user has their to 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0063.wav Okan they were paid for that product at some point in the past 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0064.wav So a simple example here is user buys a product in token form there's a big gap where a whole lot of different things can happen 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0065.wav And then someone redeems the token for the product that it represents 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0066.wav A more interesting example ah is a crowd funding basically um i'm absolutely a suckor for the use case with crowd funning it's the first thing that were going after weth tokenly and it's really 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0067.wav End a difficult time to kon a narrow in on what that is because the opportun 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0068.wav Ities here are pretty ridiculous so let's just look at this first second 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0070.wav Ed her campaign her crowd funding campaign then alice will promise bob a remote when it's ready to ship i 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0071.wav Doesn't really  work that will for bob or alic because if bob changes his mind and needs his money back he 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0072.wav Only person he can get it back from is alice and chances are pretty 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0073.wav Re that alice already spent it trying to make that remote for him 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0076.wav E funs bob and makes the project more likely to fail because one of the backers just pulled out and wanted their money back w 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0078.wav Ah or alice leaves bob with the unhappy result of he has a promise and there's no 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0080.wav So hope you like that remote 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0081.wav Once she successfully raised her money alice could 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0082.wav Instead create a unique token to represent each type of reward that she sold to her campaign backers in 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0083.wav Stead of getting a promise they have a cashlike representation of their support that they can do whatever they want with 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0086.wav D he can find somebody else who is interested to buy it from him o 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0087.wav R even set up his own online vending machine offering extra tokens he 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0088.wav As for sale and buying once that he'd like more of 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0090.wav Ly sets up her ecomerce system to accept creticards and criptocurrencies 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0091.wav Prices set in dollars with her reward tokens ah enda accepting her 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0092.wav Reward tokens affixed vollue i love that you used the term redemption john that 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0093.wav T's ta term that were nt really hearing that much yet because people view these tokens as 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0095.wav So the last and probably my favorid kind of use would be access 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0096.wav Tokens which we've been working with for about a year and a half now you 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0097.wav N can think about them like traitable passwords in cripto currency form that grant you specific kinds of access not for spending them 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0098.wav But for possessing them if we know that a single bitcoin address can contain any number of tokens e 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0100.wav Ud thn at ay website service or ap ca 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0101.wav Non exclusively ask a user to prove that they own a bitcoin address 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0102.wav And then treat its contents as the user's property giving them 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0103.wav Specific powers access privileges are rights within the platform 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0107.wav Is example alice can also decide o 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0110.wav Who has each of the various rewards now 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0111.wav Alice can let all backers access the same information or can give different specific types of permissions and even communicate differently based on the tokens each supporter has 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0113.wav Okins um i do it generically um there are a number of different technologies and protocols that you can create them on 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0115.wav Was pretty much the only stable platform at the time we were looking 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0116.wav And while every protocolhas its specific mix of advantages and disadvantages they all pr 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0118.wav Cashlike brandible tokens so the question really became for us 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0120.wav How do you make it useful 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0121.wav Another commonality between the various technologies is that the token by itself can do nothing when i am talking about token controlled access that is a two part system 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0122.wav The token part is taken care of on the block chain but the rules 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0123.wav And the the the procedures and everything 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0124.wav That a platform wants to bestow on whoever has it that all happens entirely within that close platform so it's in 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0126.wav T's just that the key no longer lives on your server where it's vulnerable to being hacked or vulnorable to being stolen and because of that again it 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0128.wav Ually having the right having the ownership of the thing that they purchase from you whether i be a membership or anything else 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0131.wav I believe was the first cryptographic a token reward's programme launched in june twenty fourteen 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0132.wav Um we'd created the token to find what kind of users would earn 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0133.wav It and even built a simple tool that sent out unique amounts to hundreds and eventually thousands of participants 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0136.wav So am one of the important things to note about the stuff is that bitcoin is where you should prototype things 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0138.wav Hains but it's nocging o beyon the basic bit coin block chain but thats e 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0142.wav R action it'swhere you can prove if your idea is worthbild 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0145.wav Excited about a theorim and everything else but the realit 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0146.wav Is is what's out now actually works we 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0148.wav Happen now and that's kind of another commonalities all this stuff happens right now 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0153.wav First sighti was hooked o this consep 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0155.wav Further it could be the basis for a whole variety of tools 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0156.wav T would enable everything from threshold base crowd funding to auctions to charity drives the only problem was jeramy's company was new and 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0157.wav Ickly became overwhelmed and to make a long story short while i'm 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0158.wav Still waiting for that essolution from vend overthe last 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0160.wav A funded my own company that's been building many of these same solutions and tools 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0161.wav So tokenly is an open source in for structure company 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0164.wav To offering your users a secure simple wall 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0165.wav Which can have individual branded tokens in it or custom brand the entire wallet although weare 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0166.wav Not encouraging people to do that becase we ave discovered that once they brand it they stop updating hit and these products are very much in development so 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0167.wav Kind of important that you keep opidating him 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0171.wav T into your store and perform normal sales credicard sales token sales and token redemptions in one easy imbedable solution 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0172.wav And also we offer everything by a pia to because that is the way of the wor 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0173.wav Ld these things need to be provided as sal 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0174.wav Utions not as an additional puzzle that everybody needs to uncover on their own 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0180.wav Alk down on this the whole reason for this talk is because there are some solutions and some very interesting ideas that once 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0182.wav That is just understood this is possible 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0184.wav So for example i live in the nappa valley and ever 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0185.wav Y year there's a big fondrezor in auction where a tendy spent about fifteen million dollars in a night 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0188.wav Uve got to do your charitable giving on that particular night 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0190.wav Per month vending machine sell a customized charity token yea 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0192.wav When the night of the auction arrives doners from all over the world bid in real time with tokens received from their donations over the course of the year and 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0194.wav An always quickly don'tate more to get that winning edge 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0195.wav Auctions really haven't changed much during my lifetime whether you're talking about e bay or that wine auction one of 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0196.wav The biggest problems is phantom bitters 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0200.wav You merely send more of the token to the auction 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0201.wav If you don't win or you've been out abit and don't intend to keep bitting you quickly and easily get all your tokens back plu 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0202.wav Is a little bonnes from whoever outbid you for your trouble 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0203.wav And why stop there each item being auction should itself be represented by a unique token redeemable for the prize 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0204.wav Which would allow people to bid and win items even if they don't want or can't use them themselves 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0205.wav In token form the prize can be traded a given and even sold without any impact or additional work on the part of whomever is providing the prize 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0206.wav And this is another commonality in the things that i am excited about they present new empowering opportunities for users wi 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0209.wav Lics netlic's streaming service as totally changed the way that i along with quite a few others consume content an 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0210.wav N for all the advantages that it has you'll notice that there are quite a few titles they don't 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0213.wav Ke their discs at a mail service can only show case titles which 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0216.wav It doesn't matter if i'd personally pay a dollar or two fifty or five dollars to watch a new releast because the studios don't trust nefhlics and lacking trust that deal can't ha 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0217.wav M imagine for a second that those publishers 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0218.wav Thlics has to negotiate with created redeemable and access tokens that represent and allow str 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0219.wav Nd allow the streaming of those premium films now instead of only having the all you can eat option nethlics 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0220.wav Has the choice to buy for sale copies as access tokens 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0221.wav Or single use tickets in the form of redeemables potentially in bulk and then renter selldom to their users for a profit 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0222.wav A user who just wants to watch the film a onck would buy the cheaper ra deemable ticket and spend it to start the movie 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0224.wav Sion and add that title o your premium library when you're done with it 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0225.wav U can land give or sell it to some one else 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0226.wav And actually neflix does even have to sell these tokens directly the fil 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0227.wav N makers or publishers can set up their own vending machines mark it directly to their audience and pay netphlicts to associate this token an 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0228.wav Ns stream their vidio as merely a content delivery network 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0230.wav S on too in every other streaming service at the same time for that matter 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0231.wav Okens up and the current reality where the platform does the picking and sometimes even gets exclusivity to one where the content creator the film maker the writer 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0232.wav Or whatever type of creative worker you can imagine can use these closed gardens merely as infr structure providers rather than having the option of partner license or go away 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0233.wav If i want to sell my audio book on audiblle why t 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0235.wav Af every sale because they have a monopoly the content lives breeds and dies on their platform and at their discretion 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0238.wav People which for all my life has been trapped on closed proprietary platforms that eventually turn into abusive monopolies an 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0239.wav D puts power into the hands of any one who wants to create 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0240.wav In an environment where only bad options exi 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0241.wav Is the least battle will suffice and that's been the story of ownership on the innernet to this 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0243.wav And put the individual on a level playing field even with the biggest platform 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0245.wav I have like ten different papers that i can share with anybody whois actually interested a detailing 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0246.wav Iffer int business monals we think that the opportunity here is absolutely huge 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0248.wav Ot a time so i'm actually not at a time i have three minutes in fifty seconds left mayn't i burned through that 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0252.wav So we've been an a closed altha um since july and basically 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0253.wav July we hit the point where we could release our 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0254.wav Very most basic tool cet and discover all the things overwr 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0255.wav Ong with it so our largest usuractualy to this point is a collectible card game 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0258.wav Electable card game and they use tokens to represent access tokens um to represent a cards within their system so a few 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0260.wav All of the tokens that correspond with cards 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0261.wav You get access to and so the feed back that we've got an 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0262.wav Ah it has been this is great were making money hand over fist 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0263.wav Ah you know can you implement this right now 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0265.wav Ayou now but but that's aid they are really our only successful usecase at this point and collectable card games 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0269.wav Because these are tools that you don't have to use 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0270.wav Yu dn't nee to go t e ba  have an auction any more basicy 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0271.wav Ll you had to do is make sure that your auction 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0272.wav Is all happening on the bicoin block chain and when it's on the bicqoin blockching i mean 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0274.wav Here's a concept that i'll just go verill briefly that i've been excited by for almost two years now called window shop 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0276.wav The idea here is that using a normal display advertisement space right so this is not very valuable s r m costfor thousand i 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0277.wav Enni's on the it it's not very valuable and that's been very frustrating me as a content crator for a long time 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0280.wav Or you now a redemption system or whatever into any web page 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0281.wav Why can't you do it in display advertisements 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0282.wav Why don't white why isn't it it that when i click on a display advertisement it pops up and sells it to me right there on the side 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0283.wav If you look at the way that a ike wicapedio works in terms of advertising 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0285.wav You'll notice very quickly that people click on adds on wickapedia because they don't care that it'sgoing to take em off the page 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0286.wav But if they if youare like on a community site where youre gin a wan o part 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0287.wav Cipate then the advertisement might be interesting but you're not looking to leave in so the stickiness 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0288.wav Of those adds in the ability to uknote to generate those clicks goes down quite a lot 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0289.wav So that i mean the rabbit hold is really deep on this one i'm 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0290.wav We're looking for partners we're looking for a basically people who can see the vision here 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0292.wav My company is entirely open source for building all of these things in away th 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0293.wav At will both spoil the market for people who for companies that try to build it in a proprietary fashion 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0294.wav Because open source has never really had this opportunity before most of the time what 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0295.wav Happens is an open source project comes in 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0296.wav After a market has already been established and so because of that their fighting in cumbency in their fighting a prior adoption b 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0298.wav I saw aur completely green field and so the way that we've built it 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0299.wav To invite every one who wants to do anything into our ego system to participate in our egosysteand become a part of a become a steward of it 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0300.wav And as such build this thing out in a way so that it can be broadly available whether low cost or no cost or 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0301.wav You know hosted solutions or not so ah thank you very much for your time my n 
MSP-PODCAST_1910_0304.wav Adam it lets tark the coindat calm if you want a gain touch 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0028.wav U've been told about the shape of the earth im so there's an up date ah he was told that he can't actually launch his homemade 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0034.wav Eary research for madma cus who planned to launch himself eighteen hundred feet up at five hundred miles an hour in an untested home made steam howered rocket over the mohavi desert 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0038.wav Pur the post the bureau of land management has confirmed that it had no record of giving hughs quote verbal permission to hold the rocket launch on public lands as he had previ 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0099.wav Um basically it's about it's a long article so we'll give a summary instead of actually sort of reading the experts that eexerts that's more interesting anyway but

MSP-PODCAST_1917_0134.wav Weird tweets like ostensibly as rion she would say like she had crippling self doubt and that's why she hadn't come out with an article an a while and like would harass 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0139.wav E melted together with his character so much that she couldn't tell like what was like where she ended and ryon began and it got like i mean that's really sc 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0158.wav And something is simple as the name on an emalic when we don't have an actual person to go on to judge somebody and stereotype them by we don't we don't have a person that we're looking at righ 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0212.wav Men people check it out but just can you give a little summary of how james your the guy that you interviewed your friend was was treated differently when he presented as a woman on mine 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0231.wav Something that happened to in author a female author wrote a book about something and she was at a conference and a man started explaining her own book to her not knowing that she 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0292.wav Should i have to do something like that but the other part of me feels like it's a fascinating science experiment and you can leart a lot from observing how differently you're treated and its way easier to present 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0332.wav S the strongest and the best swimmer it has to go through these olympic feats of going through the philopian tubes and the bagina and all the sacitic environment and it's all like a race to the 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0335.wav Olds and he shoots his dionaye right into her centre and then she forms a hard impenetrable shell leading out an 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0345.wav So like there's so many like competition and like military metaphors that are used to describe this like march of spurm across the enemy lines and like 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0359.wav Much to say about this ii can't say i'm surprised that it tends to be described that way when it may not reflect the actual reality of what actually happens in nature 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0373.wav R they're like all this is this monogamous pearbond that happens for life and yet like there is that moving march of the panguins and they were descri

MSP-PODCAST_1917_0530.wav So have i o my gosh and i think that i've been in situations before where i don't know like i like to think i never like pressure 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0561.wav Not ignoring what i genuinely want going against my own preferences for the sake of somebody else for the sake of keeping the peace for the sake of not creating 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0577.wav Partners are genuinely consenting and really think of what they want because obviously sexes is something that unless your masterbating takes more than one person to participate and

MSP-PODCAST_1917_0746.wav Ike yousociety and culture teach you how to gas light yourself almost into thinking that you weren't actually victimized or even if you were no one's going to care and so 
MSP-PODCAST_1917_0752.wav At it breaks it breaks its spell over you you know it breaks its power over you so that you can actually snap out of it and understand what happened to you
