MSP-PODCAST_2095_0027.wav In this podcast it helps for you to have a background of who i am and why i care about this and what my credentials are so 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0043.wav S well as some folks out on the street 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0044.wav Ome of them i get frequently and thoseill be the ones thati'm going to be tackling first 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0049.wav I will not necessarily be able to get to all of the questions some of the maybe questions that i've already got on my list or that i have answ 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0050.wav Wered before in which case i'll refer you to where i have answered them before 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0053.wav We are a main line denomination that has been around for a very long time i will be answering the questions f 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0058.wav I do not claim at any point to be the official voice of a my church of my specific denomination and certainly not 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0059.wav Ad the only and definitive voice of jesus christ in the world i am simply a pastor and a theologian who 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0061.wav I am not here to launch debates 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0062.wav I am not here to settle hot 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0070.wav If i get any kind of tweets or fase book messages or 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0077.wav Restle around it and come up with some questions that you might not have heard of or thought of other wise 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0078.wav So some of the questions that are already on the list that are already on my rade ar for bringing up in the podcasts that you'll be seen coming up soon in the f 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0083.wav Another one is what if the bible turns out to be wrong 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0084.wav Why does the apostles creed say that jesus descended in 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0087.wav R if i was baptized and have sort of wandered off the path do i need o be rebaptized 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0090.wav Rs that's a rough one to wrestle with especially am if you are a woman who feels a calld a ministry 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0101.wav Our denomination recently approvedd same sex arriage and so i have a lot of questi 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0104.wav I am going to be happy to share with you my opinion 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0107.wav S i certainly believe that our denomination made the right call on that 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0108.wav At i understand that there are many people who are not in that place yet theologically 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0111.wav To that conclusion from that am all marriage between two people who love one another and are committed to one another should be 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0113.wav Will there be doughnuts in heaven 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0121.wav These are sme of the ones that i have started to do research 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0126.wav I will be looking forward to them you can expect this podcast to come out on a weekly basis and each w 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0129.wav Revious things that we have discussed may be follow up questions will add those and if we get enough of them those mighty 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0130.wav En become their own separate epis 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0131.wav Out some of those follow up questions 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0133.wav Weak i pray that god will be 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0137.wav Verse seven it says ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened t 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0140.wav The guidance of the holy spirit 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0143.wav H o w e dot calm you can find more information and show 
MSP-PODCAST_2095_0144.wav O notes there as well as lynx to social media and twitter 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0010.wav Small church i still love my time with the tea nagors at the church 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0019.wav So if the bible is central to what we believe why are there so many different versions of it out there 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0023.wav The old testament also often known as the hebrew bible is known as the hebrew bible because it was written in a 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0024.wav Encient hebrew originally in fact at first it 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0025.wav It was passed down by oral tradition by story telling by song and eventually written down in hebrew 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0027.wav So especially in the case of hebrew its 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0031.wav Ich which is exactly why i love it so much 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0035.wav Ertain things in english to communicate them 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0038.wav E message of the passage as well 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0039.wav There are words in hebrew and even in greek that could meet a bunch of different things depending on the context 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0056.wav As language changes we need to change how we have translated these biblical texts into english in order to make sense to the people reading them 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0067.wav At my church we use the new international version also unknown as the n i v because it's a pretty 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0074.wav At i don't find helpful for scholarly purposes but it's 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0078.wav So if you're looking for a good translation to read at home and to take to church and you can o 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0099.wav The point the main point here is to find a version you like to read and read it 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0102.wav God just cares that people are reading and paying attention to what god has to say and 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0104.wav I say here responsible translation because if your odd uncle just wrote his own translation or something there is 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0117.wav And the life and all that come to the father come through me jesus christ is the word of god and the bible is the tool 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0118.wav Through which god communicates that word to the world 
MSP-PODCAST_2096_0119.wav My friends until the next time may peace be with you may you feel the love 
MSP-PODCAST_2097_0001.wav O day is thursday december twentieth twenty eighteen and our scripture passage this morning comes from jeremia thirty one thirty one through thirty four 
MSP-PODCAST_2097_0003.wav The day is coming says the lord when i will make a new covenant with the people of israel an 
MSP-PODCAST_2097_0005.wav Ers when i took them by the hand and brought them out of the land of egypt 
MSP-PODCAST_2097_0006.wav They broke that covenant though i loved them as a husband loves his 
MSP-PODCAST_2097_0009.wav Ake with the people of israel after those days says the lord
