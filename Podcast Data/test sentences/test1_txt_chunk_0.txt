MSP-PODCAST_0001_0050.wav Yes and so it is a classicoremovy and one of the things that makes it so classic are these bright 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0053.wav I live about a half hour from where the smooty takes place theoreticall

MSP-PODCAST_0001_0058.wav Yes so it's it's coundered a lot of attention lot of comparisons a what did you think 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0060.wav The i think you told me right before not long before i went in i think you told me how disastrpie sdid the sow track you loved disasterpiece that's awesome it's a une little thing 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0061.wav All i had a couple thoughts first of all the opening with that tracking shot and the very ominous first track heel 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0062.wav Which shees wereing heels i sooin that title came from but it was a matelike incredible and sets the tone immediately for what wats to come 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0063.wav At a certain point still early on i worried that the sound track would be a little too much it's like high in the mix 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0065.wav And you have just the again really really bright high scynth notes is tho ther part where you talking about rethought like ocavisis a bit much 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0067.wav Very strong and it in't appi i not fallen in love with it as i do with most kind of 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0068.wav Boisterous eightiese kind of horor themes i almost always fall in love with them if i like the soum track itself 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0069.wav But i would fer there was up a minute where is i was worri about get istracten 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0071.wav My i gess my bigest complaint ands that when i was watching it i remembered as i was watching o gave it this sounds like the fezsound track 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0072.wav Because disastropes did it besit i had forgotten while watching and then half way through ther these 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0073.wav Really orchostraded moments that that warn'th that wern't cynthe based as a what a on 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0074.wav Did they have multile composers on this the obviously this isn't disastropes he doesn't he does not stick to that templet he goes far beyond it and terrifies you all doing so 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0077.wav Ya rit weard a weard collection he he is so prolific has dozens of albums i think 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0078.wav If you are to disaster peace ought calm youn get everything from the excellent fesontract it follows 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0079.wav To all the wayway back when where he just has these sick metal rits and thats really entertaining 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0081.wav Um i i cann't forget about that part after the first trut t off after the very opening sounds on that tracking shot but was it 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0083.wav Very his sounds like his vidio gameside his chippe to mate thats had come 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0084.wav Yet it is absolutely when she's kind of looking at herself in the mirror s thatte is that after her before the date the first day i think the isn't the merre bit after 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0085.wav There's deatfonly a mirrabid after e feel like that moultiful mirrobets there's a lot of just drik there's a lot of just 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0086.wav Te that track ja a kind of that serif you called the title trac is there is a title track that is also good there is this really um 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0088.wav And i was really impressed by i was impressed by everything in the movie but the sound track is very deserving of the aqaade that's been ol not aqalades the praise it's been getting 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0091.wav Which is an indepindent vigury game about em going through a different worlds as a small creature with a a tiny fez hat 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0092.wav And you kind of foot perspective and it's an amazing soundract but he took those ideas and then transplated mitte of them into this 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0093.wav I will say that i do not think the sound track is as easy to listen to an the way that the feaserhoun track is 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0094.wav Its it just has a bunch of really chilling spikes and tention that make it really harder sit down or relax to 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0095.wav We both tweeded earlier to day about how we were listening to the sound track ing preparation for this and iw was in a bright 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0096.wav Bright oll brightly lits highly populated office when you were in a brightly lit room all be alone 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0098.wav Now there's a lot of a lot of he dread that comes from that movi that is just like dripping what dread throughout comes from that sound track it is it is 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0100.wav I i don't really understand this getting a vinal release and feznop as i think fez takes the best parts of the sound track 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0101.wav In i morphsome beautiful a so i really recommend that people go check that out wat's kind of have reason i' what to do esis villagars validates my opinion its am sup pist off that no one else 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0103.wav I have heard it mentioned a couple times in a like our mooly potcassan such like that's that go to reference is 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0105.wav I guess so i have t say about it but i do want to talk aof e moovy cause i actually do have a few thoughts after reading some interviews and ey would be a shame if we just dedicate this only to the music 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0106.wav Because there's a lot good a lot of great things going out ith that movy as well i have a lot of thoughts 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0109.wav Period othe the period of ambiguity of his reading interview i can't remember which source i will find out and i will put it in the post where the spotcest is 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0110.wav Ah but david robert mitchell said that he intentionally wanted to confuse people about the period that it takes place so you see 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0111.wav A mica's sister is it her sister or friend cause she looks completely different is look anything like a michamonera 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0114.wav So they've pretty much span every decade possible and then added technology that doesn't even exist to day in it 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0121.wav Now that's ju scaba in the high in the highly referential society we live in now and moving the cartemovies especially 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0122.wav I am all lean on that aestetic so they can go ahod and keep doing that i don't know when ill get tired of it but 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0123.wav Well the big besides the music the other really overt choice was the camel work in it 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0124.wav It reminded me a bit of james wan with the conjuring where it can almost be distracting with how active it is and how playful it is 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0126.wav I remember it would was rotating in a circle in the hallway as they were going to look at the year book trying to find her what she thought was her boy fruns 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0128.wav Didn't even pause for a second on the person walking towards it a counted is kept rotating and it did a lot of stuff like that througt movi that was just really cool 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0131.wav But i thought they did an excellent jib with that similar to the sound track where they went right up to the line of too much but stayed 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0132.wav Mike gyllacus was a somotographer him trying to look et what he did on line 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0133.wav Ah hes thirty one credits so seeing if you knew anything else that he had don bes did notice that the por waare talking about in the school where it spens 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0134.wav I thought for a moment that they were just trying to keep us in almost the eyesight of what the the creature was seeing 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0135.wav But then i realize i can wait a minute no there they're keeping us aware that it's still around them but not where exactly it is or how close it is 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0136.wav I don't thinkin ever they played a couple times i think with of owe did john dise at the end but they played a couple times with it 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0139.wav Yes sir i yes louise in that case i guess it is from the first firson but the gets a school unless so i dn't 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0142.wav There is a little non there is not many jump scares i don't think ah 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0143.wav Not what i would hope of to be but i still found it absolutely absolute terrifying  physically dreadful the vilge so hard to talk about horror him 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0145.wav But i i've my heart was jus pumping out of its chest i just i was like onbasely sitting on top my groing if i take me home i can't do that ense 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0146.wav But i've i've had a run to that with a couple people in one my good friend said i liked it but it wasn't sary i had other people who didn't like it cause it wasn't scary 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0148.wav The what makes it so terrifying for me is the building dreadd throughout an the fact that you're never safe 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0150.wav Worse really well like even when it's obvious sans like othes some one's walking towards up now up ther walking past like even that very obvious 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0151.wav I went in the bodcast with your theory about what you would do if you were in the situation you you woke up with this curse wal 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0153.wav Which i know is intentionally dumb because this takes place entirely in like the universe of youth like their hardlyidiadults 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0154.wav I'm just thinking they're not that young they're like nineteen like thes the mooi specifically says that she is nineteen and they are around her age 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0155.wav That is like some twelve year old mavil pointing but i mean i wide with it obviously 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0156.wav And and i i cout have enjoyed it because in the ghas che plays a very savvee 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0160.wav It kind just go as kits are stupid leok a   they're done they don't know what to do and 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0161.wav The second point is obviously the sex place a big part in the movie we haven't talked about it much beyond your intro 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0162.wav But the whole sex is bad thing and it works that it a works gone it it isn't exploitetive like so many of these things often are because it punishes every one it's 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0167.wav Amobviously it is not some kind of feminist um landmark in horror felm 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0168.wav But e li one with a friend who feels very strongly about these things and she agreed 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0175.wav A erseeb a gu like three guys on a boat and my thoughlis it right she's going to have every som and then hope that 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0178.wav The od i should also say the opening scene with the boy it makes him looks like he's going a date rap per 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0180.wav It's not great but i it could have been very very bad withow it handled the subject matter and i thought it did a much better jomp in it 
MSP-PODCAST_0001_0182.wav I'm living on a boat man scon't live on a boat and like well move like iyou have to go to shore but you'll sudde move

MSP-PODCAST_0047_0027.wav And mark is mark seems to be pretty taken with the film but he's got a lot of analysis for the film he he he hasn't just looked at it 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0029.wav Ah every time i every time ive hung out with him recently he's had different observations and 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0030.wav I'd got to the point where i just realized we need to talk about this movy and the show 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0032.wav As well i i avoided this film for some reason even though ih've heard nothing but a 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0034.wav Ah substantial praise from from a few of my film friends out whose opinions i take rather serious mark obviously being being one of them 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0045.wav And as of late he's he's really brushed out of that john romore and gonmore into an an agonmore into psychological complexity the 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0049.wav On just the politics of sex and in numerous states and forms a he made crash and ninety six based on j g ballard's film 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0053.wav A which had some extraordinary performances in ther including one by curenitly who continues to a baffle me with the fact that she has become a good actress

MSP-PODCAST_0047_0063.wav Ah but ive been i've been chatting long enough i want to hand this over to mark because every time that he he talks about this felm i just i i' just like 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0064.wav Struck i just a  ay i think about the fill more and more 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0071.wav Sequences of sound affects editing because there's never a moment 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0072.wav Where it it it falls into farce where it becomes comical or or where it becomes unbelievable where it becomes over the top and it's a totally over the top scene 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0077.wav A believe it its sereal in its believability and the sound of the flesh hitting flesh in that steam rum 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0092.wav And he would play them in his car while walking around and 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0095.wav And the mixing always it never spikes like it never it never gets really loud it never gets really quiet like like like marcosan lic broadcast telivision

MSP-PODCAST_0047_0219.wav Oh yes fine abacco you can fet you drawrs fron plug and then yessin infidio drom he he's able to 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0220.wav Like he sticks his hand in his stomach and and pulls out a gun or puts a gun in his stomach 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0221.wav A the vidio tape scene is especially my favorite 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0222.wav Ne and and it's still great it's it's it's it's great but 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0223.wav But he he kin of walks 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0224.wav Out he he is not to conhe doesn't seem concerned about the suspension of disbelief 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0225.wav Ahm with these flesh transyou know like with the flesh and and it seems to me that 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0226.wav You know i'm sure they try their best to do a great make up job but it it always just looks like this putty on a person's face or er er putty on their back 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0229.wav I don't really care that you know this is fate like were 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0230.wav Weare all in agreement that this is fiction and it's not real 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0232.wav Positing this narrative that you can then sort of go with nd and if you can't suspend your disbelief than tough luck 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0233.wav Anyway i don't know i've talked a long time but wuld be a 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0234.wav Now that's a really astute observation you just made and i think that might be the link 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0235.wav Cause there's links between cronaburg's work even even films that seem completely unrelated to other ones 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0236.wav Ah there's a thread that runs through his movies like 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0237.wav Like you could say that a i mean not all of them but like you said they do with the flesh 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0238.wav And they deal with ah the about the beauty the ghastliness 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0239.wav And the way that dome it's almost like our sin 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0240.wav But he's not that he's he's not that cheap he doesn't he doesn't go on levels that that easily perceived 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0242.wav My favorite fill makers are fill makers that have themes that consistently run through their work 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0243.wav Acturfill maker allit say would that would be 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0244.wav Wen't even like ivan spilberg you know like like like how he's obsessed with like that not a sass i how he has like the child like sense of wonder and awe how he 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0245.wav How he just that's a consistent motef whether he's producing or directed or 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0246.wav It's something it's even in men in black it has that it has that ability to bring you back to being nine years old 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0247.wav If korneberg has that ability to thoroughly psychologically and spiritually disgust 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0248.wav While also ou no makeng you laugh at the same time because it's so over the top it's like one part 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0249.wav Im am i can't mar if it's rob botton or rob boatin 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0250.wav He uses those those like that those those flesh pody effacts he uses latax offacts en 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0251.wav Ah rather than going the route of laxsigi e 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0252.wav But there's am there's two scenes in an history of islence which was the first film that i could remember there being like like blatan sie g ey 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0253.wav Eggs estends used more more potent special effects than i could remember seen in any film befootdop kroneberg film before that 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0254.wav And it seems like he's pushing the line on himself while also remaining the same it he's still cronenberg 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0255.wav And a a dangerous method was a real far departure from what i think bcause there is not a single horror aspect to the film 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0256.wav But the idea of horror it was was real inishing a anthony man the 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0257.wav The film critic at am at the new yorker wrote about this different kind of horror about 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0258.wav Am the horror of aging and howl am 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0260.wav Because it was this film about watching that this this man with woman who absolutely loved each other in the dissolution of a relationship 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0261.wav And how ah just what you know the look on his face as he was watching his wife crumble 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0262.wav Am was that was a totally new type of horror film that had never existed 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0263.wav Fornably me just a jump in and say a horror has become a jat ithas become a joner probably 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0264.wav Am since probably i guess you could say scarst one as sinis the novels of am 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0266.wav Ah i would guess that you know if you were to read up on it but i'm sure there's prarly some somethings that precurse 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0267.wav A pri pri m that predate edgra al and poen and also were toke about western society 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0268.wav John it became it it it its become a catified jonra 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0269.wav And so when we say horror we mean this catified jonra 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0270.wav A and what yours what your suggesting gabe is 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0271.wav That amor is another kind of hor by saying a mor is another kind of hor is a little bit like saying 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0272.wav I can't think of a great example but let's say it would be a little bit like 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0273.wav A taking ammet transcendental meditation 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0275.wav Have you e such a diorent i hear you 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0276.wav Aa celuri different experience that it doesn't even 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0278.wav Any unal a documentary on the hall cost is another kind of bor 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0280.wav It's million a million miles away from being gatified as a jonera 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0282.wav You know maybe something like the scene in the shining where 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0283.wav Am the woman in the bath tub 
MSP-PODCAST_0047_0284.wav Is all of sudden aged and that's horrifying or or maybe or maybe some some david lynch scenes where you know of david lynch

MSP-PODCAST_0114_0001.wav Now it was bit coin at the time i gave it to them they refunded it to me in bit coin and it was about a fifty per cent loss on the bit coin that i had put in at the time so that pretty much 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0002.wav To  goo job of s carrying me away from mining under most circumstances 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0003.wav We periodically receive emales asking for guidance on minding specifically this comes from new users wo cure that al well it's bit coin and you can actually just use your computer remind it that was true at one point 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0005.wav In the nemol yesterday we heard from a listener wanting to know about a cloud mining company that they were interested in 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0006.wav I hadn't heard of the one that they mentioned so i gave conemy generic answer that mining by itself is expodentially more risky 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0007.wav And dangerous than bitcoin because it has all the variables of bit coin that can go against you but it also has other variables like mining difficulty that you also don't control 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0009.wav Stephany this is the first thing that i hear in most times talking of people new to bitcoin how do i mine 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0010.wav I know that you've played with all coins sum and that you've played around with that kind of mining seen just for fun 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0012.wav What was that experience like and is there anything to it aymore 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0013.wav No i'm not still doing it and i i wouldn't recommend that anyone else do it either 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0016.wav Very early on like two thousand nine twenty ten stuffed like that 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0019.wav Never mend i won't tell that story but they were just all these stories of a people going to crazy lanx to mind bicquains early on and for some of them that really paid off 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0020.wav Not at the time not immediately but once bicoin went up in value a little bit more 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0022.wav They could have used that money that they put into their mining rags 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0023.wav To buy bitcoin and the prubly could have bought more bitcoin with it and they still would have been successful because that's just speculation 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0024.wav And lot of people who were successful in mining early on were also speculating on the biquoin that they mined by holding on to it and that's were it really paid off 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0026.wav For those who don't know how it works i can give my best lay persons explanation 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0028.wav And whethe're trying to find is a a solution a hash a mouth problem 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0029.wav A number that comes out to be a very improbable thing 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0030.wav Gets a random number that they're looking for and they want to have that number meet a some specific crateria like 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0031.wav Let's say it's less than a million or something like that or less than ten thousand or it starts with us string of like eight leading zeros 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0032.wav That's very improbable when you're discussing random numbers so they have to 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0034.wav And the difficulty of those guesses goes up as more miners jump into the pool 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0035.wav To make it so that a solution is found about every ten minutes 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0037.wav When a minor finds a solution they get to author a bloc 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0039.wav And as a reward for doing that as an incentive to keep writing the block chain 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0040.wav They get a block reward which at this point is twenty five biquoins per block it used to be fifty 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0041.wav And most of t e people that i know who ever mind jumped in when it was fifty 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0042.wav I knew one guy who was finding blocks by himself with just as computer c p u this is brellybackin two thousand nine 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0044.wav That was how little vicquains were worth at the time 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0048.wav And if you were thinking short term back in the day when it was kind of feasible to mind bicquoins as an individual 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0054.wav Everybody would just be going for the biccoins really and it would lose its purpose 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0056.wav It's never really profitable in the short term to mine 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0058.wav Of having the chance to basically speculate on becquin really early on and that's what paid off for them 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0059.wav Originally you asked adam about was i still mining 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0063.wav And that was one of the only allcoins that was available at the time 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0065.wav I built a computer ahum with a couple of graphics cards 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0067.wav And a lot of em burned out in the process probably cause i wasn't cooling it effectively because the power supply was not quite matched to what what the computer needed 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0070.wav Amateur minors make but it was really fune it was just it was fun to participate on that and just see how it workd 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0072.wav I made enough like coin to pay off the investment that i'd made in building this computer 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0073.wav But also with a lot of electricity i'm not sure that i broke even on the electricity h 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0074.wav It was vasically like increasing my power bill quite a bit 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0078.wav But i guess maybe at one point i had some hope or illusion that maybe i would make a prophet but that wasn't really how it turned out he he 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0079.wav So a uactually  reminded me the one time that i did mind besides that was the protoshere's launch which originally was build if you remember as the the s pw minable thing so it was the thing that was going to 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0080.wav Returned and equal spread a distribution that didn't take in account of the big asic manufacturing ownership and all that jas 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0082.wav And then by day four or five it was too tough that i stopped doing it because it was just botherin my computer and i' wanto have it hont any more 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0083.wav Ye in fact didn't well at the time they were in victis but didn't dan larimer 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0086.wav Broto shares but then by the time they actually received them they were basically obsolete because someone had countercracked the algarithem and it wasn't worth it any more 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0087.wav It wasn't it wasn't anybody to crack the agarithm it's just that there's this really hard problem 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0088.wav Between having something that's easy to mind and having something that doesn't scale well for a single person who has some money in that's the issue is that 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0089.wav Regardless of whether its asix or sepews or whatever 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0091.wav It's about the amount of money that you can throw ut the problem really much more than anything else 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0092.wav Stepany i i remember you didn't interview with  with a new minor actually gosh this must have been about a year ago 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0094.wav Yes and he was he was mining on kayand see minor hardware which at the time that was really 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0097.wav But yet he bought these expensive machines he paid like ten thousand dollars for two machines 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0101.wav He was really thrilled about that but it wouldn't have happened if the viquin price had not gone up 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0102.wav Right i mean there's that huge variable of luck i mean you described it as a lottery ticket even beyond the lottery ticket element of just winning the race and getting the bit coin 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0103.wav There's also this other thing where the price is just completely out of your control and fit had on the other way than he would have had a very negative experience but 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0106.wav He paid for those machines with creditcards that didn't have interest for a year or something like that 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0109.wav Adam yure talking about the lottery ticket aspect of mining 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0113.wav Then what you're trying to do is a really herculean task it's like finding a needle in a haystack 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0114.wav You are using your machine to compute these hashes 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0115.wav And hoping that you get one that comes out in the correct way that will fulfil the requirements to solve the block 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0120.wav The reason minding pools exist is because people want to spread out that risk a little bit so if they do 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0125.wav Or you may get lucky an get it the next day but if you'r sola mining you're always taking that risk of how long or you can have to play the game before you hit the jack pot 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0126.wav Even thoughyou keep the hole reward yourself purses joining a pool 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0127.wav And having that sort of guaranteed ioch if i put in this much power i'm going to get this many blockerwards back out the other side and it's more of a sure thing 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0128.wav So bit coin mining is sort of predictably unpredictable and of what it sounds like a kin like 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0130.wav But you have no idea when it'll actually falls like flipping a coin like statistically you should know how it's going to wind up but 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0132.wav Cloud miners add like another layer of a abstraction on top of that separating people who are thinking of themselves as miners from the actual work of mining 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0133.wav Clodminers are essentially paying to be exposed to profit generated by mining company machines 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0134.wav But as some one buying cloudmoney you are actually own or control the machines yourself 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0135.wav So if you have one of these sicifi cloud mining operation becomes successful 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0136.wav It actually seems to me that it represents just about the truest point of centralization in the bit coin eqo system 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0137.wav That one can imagine because n unlike a standard pool it's actually quite difficult for a miner to leave 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0138.wav And drayus last year i really got concerned and a little obsessed about the decentralization problem as i saw it 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0139.wav With bit coin and i'm wondering like is decentralization something that's even necessary in this system and 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0141.wav It is necessary in the system because consensus of tak can be more easily created 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0142.wav So when you centralize mining power what you're doing is your vesting trust 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0143.wav In a narrow and narrow part of the system 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0145.wav Then the truss that they have to not double spend transactions 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0146.wav To not delay blocks or create restrictions on transactions on plocks 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0147.wav That comes from the fact that they don't have the power concentrated in just a few hands 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0149.wav And the disincentive is that if you don't play by the rules those who do will be in greater numbers and will actually gain the the system 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0150.wav If you concentrate power in fewer hands then you have to vest them with trust 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0154.wav And effectively what you've done as you've recreated papal you've re created visa you've created a centralize claring house organization 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0156.wav Just like you do in eccentralized environment like vizon bapel and on the other extreme you have 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0161.wav Personally i i definitely see the point of why setoci built this algarythm in a distributed decentralized way 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0162.wav The idea that the power and trust should not be concentrated in the hands of one or a few but i as many as possible 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0164.wav At what point are we basically just saying well everyone might as well like weave their own shirts out of cotton that they grow in their backyards and grow all their own food 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0165.wav At what point are we ignoring the division of labor thing 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0166.wav When i was a liquan minor in my short career as a liquane minor 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0167.wav I sucked i was burning out my graphics cards 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0168.wav I was creating all this heat i couldn't keep it cool i couldn't keep the thing on i had to keep rer booting it it was inefficient 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0169.wav And these people who have these large warehouses where their cooling it with the arctic col 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0170.wav Some were in skin and naviaor nthe north pole even and they're hooking up their machines correctly so that they don't burn out their cards 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0171.wav Whereas i didn't know what i was doing and i had to learn those mistakes the hardway 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0172.wav They're more efficient at doing that than me so why not have a little bit of division of labor here 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0173.wav So that the whole process can be a little more efficient their costs o decentralization too 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0174.wav Absolutely decentialized systems are far more costly than having essentialized claring house 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0176_0001.wav In the labour of the clearing house but that's a compromise that most of the people who are in bitquin a willing to make 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0176_0002.wav N the reason they're willing to make that is because when you concentrate pyr in a clearing house it's more efficients 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0177.wav But then the claring house has enormous power and they attend to abuse them 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0178.wav They use that power in order to establish monopolies 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0179.wav So you end a paying for that efficiency and externalities in the system 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0180.wav So let's look at a couple of case studies i mean there have been points in the past where some of the bicquin mining pools have gotten close to the theoretical scary number of fifty one per cent 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0181.wav That is having more than fifty per cent of the network cashing power 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0182.wav That they could then use to initiate double spens 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0183.wav Or to do other nefarious things that could mess with bicuoin 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0184.wav There was the pool g hashed out i o 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0185.wav And they did actually get o fifty one per cent for a time right and then people started to leave the pool i guess concerned 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0186.wav Bitquoin miners who didn't want that pool to have more than fifty one per cent because they feared it would ruin bitcoiner negatively effect bitcoin propably justly so 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0187.wav People left it until it got smaller 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0188.wav And it happened with a couple of other mining pools  in the past 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0189.wav I can't remember the first time it happened but it was one of these early mining pools and now i'm just forgetting their name do you either of you guies remember 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0190.wav Missus b t c gild in in the old days 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0192.wav Happened with b t s gild where they were approaching fifty one per cent as wall 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0193.wav Where they gat close to thirty five forty forty five per cent of the network power 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0194.wav I guess that was because they were a good mining pool because they erd out how to serve their customers which are the people who are contributing pak hour to the mining pool 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0195.wav And at it became popular because wanted to smining pool where they got the best orwards or weather 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0196.wav Vervis but then that became a daedalegesword because people started to leave as they became scared of that du on per cent potential 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0197.wav There has not yet been an instance where a mining pool had so much hashing power and they decided to abuse it 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0199.wav But there have been those instances in alk coins 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0200.wav And actually that happens quite frequently because speaking of biquain mining a lot of people have invested in bitquain mining hard where er which is now pretty much worthless for biquain 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0201.wav But if they can find a new al coin if it's smining on the same algrathm as bequan shat fifty six 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0203_0001.wav And pretty soon they might be well on the way to taking over the network of that new fludgeling alt coin or the al coin that not many people are muc 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0203_0002.wav Inding a contress there lots of all coinds out there and lots peoples mining powers limited 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0204.wav There have been instances where other coins have kinds of attects 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0205.wav I think there was one on terracoin 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0206.wav Do you guas remember that i think we talked about it on the show more than a year ago e 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0207.wav There have been a few fifty one percentatax but there haven't been that many i 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0209.wav You know in the entire cripto currency canopoaly unless i'm just not hearing about most 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0210.wav I would say probably they're not like huge events any more i mean 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0211.wav What can some one do with the fifty one per cent attack is another question like ismeout this big scary thing 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0212.wav But really the worst thing that they can do pretty much is do a double spend and then put that double spent coin into an exchange 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0213.wav Get real bit coin or real fiat from that and then it was actually a double spend in the exchanges out or they buy a product with it in the product ships sir or something but mostly its exchanges 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0214.wav Andras would you agree that's pretty much like the worst thing one can do with a double spend o tack or a fifty one per cent attack 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0215.wav Well yes not only is that the misunderstanding that persists out there is that 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0216.wav A people can use this to steal money and they can't 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0217.wav You can do a double spend a tack that you have to then either get a product ship or an exchange with drawl to happen for it to be valuable 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0218.wav However you can also do a denial of service attack which is probably more serious 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0219.wav Di nol of service stac against transactions or of the mining 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0220.wav Pools in such a way as to maintain dominance over a double spent possibility or capability 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0221.wav So once you get fifty on per cent attack you can use that to keep others for mining blocks 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0222.wav To a poit where you maintain that hashing power by starving them of rewards 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0223.wav You said the misconception is that people can use a double spend er fifty one per cent a tack to steal money 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0224.wav You're talking about like rewriting history write like if i have bit coins in my bitcoin address the idea which is mistaken 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0225.wav Could literally roll back the block chain and roll back history and take those bicquoins out of my bicquoin address and give it to themselves right 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0226.wav Well no not only that but it has nothing to do with rolling back history wich eder's two aspects that first of all 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0227.wav You can't create a transaction which you don't have signing authority over it whether you control fiftuumpsenit of the network or not whether you can pull off itoompresent attac or not 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0228.wav You still ca't control funds that you don't have signing authority or keys for all you can do is 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0229.wav Spend your own funds and then after someones exchange those funs for something else rewrite history and then spend those funds again 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0230.wav And deprive the recipients of those funds from those funds but you can't spend other people's funds or create transactions that a bogus were signed without having keys and things like that 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0231.wav So there's a big misunderstanding of exactly what you can do however the destroptive potential is there 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0232.wav Keep in mind though that there's this big economy which is that 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0233.wav The coins on which it is easy to do fifty one per cent a tax don't usually have monetory value 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0234.wav That is worth doing it double spend attack for and most of these attaxs have just being malicious and did not live service orented 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0235.wav And the coins that do have value especially bit coin 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0236.wav It's not possible at the moment wit was the hashing capase that tout there 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0238.wav And there's a reason for that i's because the incentives are a line to prevent you from doing that 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0239.wav First of all a lot of people are watching so that when 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0241.wav Uple's livelihood is threatens this economy is threatens so people make a big fuss about it 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0242.wav Miners are insented to change poles and two things about it 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0243.wav And people notice when there is a double spend attack or a potential for double spend attack 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0244.wav Where it's most profitable to do one 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0245.wav It's hardest to do one and where it's easy to do an attack it's not very profitable so that that's one of the 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0246_0001.wav Things that makes us at least makes me look at fifty onpresent attax is a very interesting theoretical possibility in something we 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0246_0002.wav We need to be onthe look out for beaware of the possibility 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0247.wav But at the same time i don't consider it a practical 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0248.wav Threats to bit coin as it is to day because i think that the market will always ajost to protect the value of the nutwork 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0249.wav Given that ta youkno we think the decentralization is good and we think that it's necessary and and positive in bitcoin mining 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0250.wav I've often wondered what is centralization now relative to other times in the past 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0251.wav Because it seems like again we know fortr for many the reasons that stephani mentioned 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0252.wav Youknow that simply put she isn't a specialist in it and so theire's like this natural drive for the people who stay in as the as the pie stays the same 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0254.wav Are the ones that are able to continue to increase their productivity 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0255.wav Relative to the rest of the napricsett that's a very elyte group of people 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0256.wav So the question here iis basely just has centralization orare we as bad as we've ever been 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0257.wav Are we you know half as bad as we've ever been what do you think the state is 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0258.wav Of mining centralization now relative to other times in viquence history 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0259_0001.wav It's a moving target because the thing is it it absen flows and it goes in cycles 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0259_0002.wav E have cycles of centialization and then yeu have cycles of decential sation the overall trandists toward centialization 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0260.wav You can look at the stats so for example if you look at mining stats 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0262.wav Places thy block chain in full ore the places tat contain 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0263.wav Mining statistics you can look at the percentage of blocks being discovered by various mining pools and see how that change is over time 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0264.wav Where do we see mining going from here 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0265.wav The natural leadin i think actually is to talk about a bit shares because it is 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0266.wav One hundred rotating delegates no mining proof of work whatsoever 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0267.wav Like ten second transactions and so they are like the example of ta centralization for those performance increases and for those busibility benefits 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0269.wav And ye'l like that's a good thing from one perspective in that it provides this stuff 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0270.wav But it also is in theory more centralized because there are only a maximum of one hundred one participants actually having a say at any given time 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0271.wav Why if we any talk about that we could also talk about just proof of stake 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0272.wav A hundred per cent proofs of staecoins which are really interesting 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0273.wav There are some people who are opposed to them 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0274.wav I one of the biggest criticisms that i've seen is the so called nothing at stake problem 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0275.wav As i understand it there's no cost to a proof of stake forger or miner 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0276.wav To mining on different block chains and so if they if they wanted to mine on an alternate block chain they can do that 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0277.wav And they can do it on as many as they want withs no cost 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0278.wav Whereas with a proof of work currency there is a cost tu mining on alternate block chains 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0279.wav So here's a question stephany if you had reasonable amount of pur of pure coiner whatever would you have continued mining 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0280.wav Or would you have stopped at basicly the same point was it about profitability or was it about inconvenience of using mining 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0282.wav At the time when i was mining there really were no proof of stakecoins except pear coin which is only half proof of stake its half proof of work there were no one hundred per cent proof of stake coins at that time 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0283.wav So i didn't really have the option of just using a hundred per cent proof of stacoin 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0284.wav But yam i mean it doesn't oke so a proof of state coin to forget or minded all you have to do is hold some amount of the coin and have the client open 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0285.wav That's just not as fun lehier cus no engineering involved 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0286.wav So so the the work makes it fun the work and or that's part of the enjoyment of 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0287.wav It was a it was a curiosity thing i think 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0288.wav I guess it's an accomplishment whereas this is religious more like hay i turned on the oten abbit it's 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0290.wav I just love the smell of burnt capacitors in the morning 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0292.wav Smellyaimen that's the question is does that actually add value ibly is that part of what's adding value to bit quing because i mean again like mining people think about it like 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0293.wav Mining is the process of processing transactions that's just not ture mining is the process of creating a number 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0294.wav That is unique to you based on the amount of work that ou're putting in essentially 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0295.wav And then that number is compared against everybody else in space essentially it's a gross simplification 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0296.wav Why would disagree with out adam i mean i think there is ae big misunderstanding 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0297.wav Between means and ends in mining 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0299.wav Is a reward system the goal of mining 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0300.wav Is to provide security and verification of transactions for the network 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0301.wav That is the function of mining it verifies transactions its aggregates transactions into blocks 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0302.wav And it acts as a gate keeper to aces to the block chain so that the things that are recorded in the block chain are verified 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0303.wav The new coins that are created 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0304.wav Transaction fees that's not the goal of mining that's not why mining exists to just create new coins you 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0306.wav Mining exists in order to provide security in the form of a dessentralized clearing house through concensus 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0307.wav And the reward system is there to encourage that behaviour in a way that supports the network and end 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0309.wav But it's it's often easy to confuse the the means with the end 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0311.wav Based on the statistics that iam looking at here 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0312.wav At the moment the discus fish mining pool has about twenty eight per cent 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0314.wav This is over last twenty four hours ovr the last 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0315.wav Our days again twenty eighth per cents for discus fish 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0316.wav Sixteen per cent for gi hushdoio seven per cent frcansee minor 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0317.wav Five per cent for bet s guild five percent for alecis 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0318.wav So i would say base on those statistics that at the moment 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0319.wav We are less centralized than we were this past summer 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0320.wav When she hash came close to i think forty eight per cent or fifty per cent at some point i don't think they ever her fifty one 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0321.wav That's really interesting because abasically the giant that last time this was a real concern g hashtotio has been unseated and this newcomer discus fish that wasn't even really around 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0322.wav That i remember before has risen to the top almost 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0323.wav So it does seem like there's a lot of fluks and transition in which mining pooles are dominant 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0325.wav We just had an election where the you know the exists the ruling party was 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0326.wav Thrown out no world changing results and all the stuff and the new parties gone in of course was the old party eight years ago or six years ago so  im in ya 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0327.wav It's been alternating basically democrat republican democrat republican in the he 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0328.wav You ask for right brakes or at each of them 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0329_0001.wav Well but i meed it seems like a similar dynamic as is it play here right because it makes sense to be part of the biggest mining pool 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0329_0002.wav Because that means you get more rewards more often since the pool that you're repart of is finding more blocks than the pools that are smaller 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0330.wav So there's that incentive to be part of the biggest group until you get to that point 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0332.wav And you have exactly the same problem a couple months later something like it's just like 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0333.wav Back and forth back and forth right now as appears like we're in teab i'll be curious to see if discuss fish becomes the next quote problem 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0334.wav I really wonder what satocy's opinion on this would be 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0335.wav Bulfly sitoce's out there maybe on an island somewhere 
MSP-PODCAST_0114_0336.wav But yalike what does satoci think about this i think it might have been not what setoce expected starting out in bickcoin when bickoin was new 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0130.wav And a he had some swelling in his feet was at one foot or was at both feet 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0149.wav With every patien that's just really sad gone derrol 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0221.wav El you mentioned something before the show mark that you found the only thing you found offensive 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0250.wav I mean this just seems like a law that you could use to get any one that you didn't like 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0367.wav Urny handcock has a few but  not as extensive as fretock 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0382.wav His mind just seezs trany respos 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0633.wav And that's the example that you use mark isn't i guess an abstrete extreme example of justification i think that some of the more extreme ones ar em 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0650.wav Do you think that's because men are generally physically more developed in people view them as threatening if they say 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0693.wav Ye what's the difference between eighty and ninety dumb 
MSP-PODCAST_0115_0737.wav Was the state briots when ernha allowed to have other religious beliefs ye 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0031.wav Probably ah and that's an let's talk about that for a minute because i had said 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0038.wav Or may be even money entirely 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0062.wav The inesate does this all the time maybe we should do something about that 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0067.wav Nobody in society is coming out in saying well it's lookay if we don't look but it's all right if the government does wait a minute 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0072.wav So readily and no one in the media 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0134.wav Replacing you know are a lot of our analogue ways of doing things i'm in handing stuff over to that 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0137.wav It looks like okaya there's no way robats would kill a human being 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0153.wav I don't hear guglinfact i know for a fact that larry page 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0154.wav Does not have a problem with governments i know he's not a libertarian that he's not an anarchist 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0196.wav Time now for ninety seconds on sex with doctor paul 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0235.wav Is getting traded on beeteir 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0243.wav That is a future that you just made 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0247.wav No governments involved 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0353.wav And the concern there is that if you don't have a lot of people to check your code ok ecause you don't want to fall into the open source fallacy ok openness to sell 
MSP-PODCAST_0120_0354.wav Is open source does that make it inherently good no harp blead
