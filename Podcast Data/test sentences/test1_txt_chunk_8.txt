MSP-PODCAST_0773_0031.wav Unfortunately most of them i dadn't really care about right cause 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0054.wav And she did in appearance on alex jones's show talking about

MSP-PODCAST_0773_0067.wav You know it is easy to say oh i'll be tortured or im o que with goin to jail for my rights 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0068.wav It's easy to say that in the moment but when you actually are faced with that it's a completely different story

MSP-PODCAST_0773_0116.wav No this was just taking it and it was also really cool because 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0119.wav Libertarian or anarchists and democrat and with bit coin i was able to engage with people 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0121.wav I as an artist have always wanted to bring people together to have a massive impact on mankind and not just whatever 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0131.wav Teacher and that's pretty much the end of that relationship what if you don't like some of the prizes that i'm offering right so it's not ideal and 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0138.wav Um and that was a really rude awakening for me an it ended up happening there were several redely really awful things that happened to me um 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0150.wav So those of you who don't know of the story of the silk road i would recommend watching a movy called deep web and deep web a was put out 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0159.wav He went to trial believing in this system that there would be justice and he acted with am

MSP-PODCAST_0773_0168.wav Wanted to you know party i mean you know why is 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0172.wav How he's never changed his message hes never 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0177.wav Those things are really hard and when you have all these kind of false profits around you and all these vaque people but then all these inspiring people it really takes a toll 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0178.wav And one of the things that he wrote me am in a letter was you know tatiana i awen in the meantime and in telugis 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0186.wav Kind of high likes it right because he has that impact on me and then i have an impact on the guy 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0188.wav Even if the guy didn't write me i don't know how many people i'm impacting and rawlis doesn't know how many people he is impacting so

MSP-PODCAST_0773_0194.wav He was 't thinking about it from a selfish perspective he was consistent in his desire to improve mankind 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0195.wav Even in this personal exchange that he had with me it's not like people who 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0197.wav Those people i think are a lit of fakers too they just want us seem feel superior 
MSP-PODCAST_0773_0203.wav Thirty forty years later there would be some singer songiter an new jersey a trying to inspire others and an i have orgubly inspired people so

MSP-PODCAST_0773_0273.wav Costing me and then what it ends up taking of my time and then i kinda trying figure something out from there
