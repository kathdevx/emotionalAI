MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0039.wav However ah if we we hve if we have to look at things through this

MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0045.wav But even then i had a strong feministe perspective imparted to me by my father during those years he was a member of the evefeminist children's book club and many of the books 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0046.wav I was reading came from there even as i was experiencing the opposite of a positive mal roll modle in my main home when i went to my dance at weekens

MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0048.wav I was dressed in hand me downs from my niece which meant that i was regularly sent to primary school wearing pink jeens 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0049.wav I didn't really conceive of the idea that but boys and girls were significantly different 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0051.wav From then until i was about fifteen all my friends would be boys 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0052.wav I occasionally had girl friends but i didn't have girl 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0054.wav We basically self seggregated ourselves along gender lines 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0056.wav I was around nine years old when charmane case dropped my rubber on the floor 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0057.wav And when i reached  down to pick it up she flashed me her volver 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0058.wav When i was ten or so i told rebecca swift who i was going out with tha 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0059.wav It wasn't right for us to continue to go out because i'd seen charmanesvolver but i hadn't seen hers 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0060.wav This resulted in us showing each other our genitils behind the back of her garden shed 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0061.wav Although i wasn't aware of it at the time 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0062.wav This was as your laughter suggests a very maniplative move and looking back at it makes me shudder 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0064.wav And even in terms of the practicalities 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0065.wav There were clearly some gaps in my understanding as my invention of masturbation should demonstrate 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0068.wav Instead of learning consent and desire why instead managed to learn was guilt 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0071.wav I was inventing mastubation next door to the room where my mamman my step 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0072.wav Dad were ripping each other apart sex became something linked with sadness to me 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0073.wav Awaiy ta momentarily block out the screaming rouse 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0074.wav I think the shaming we had all taught to perpetuate makes all genders into weapons against each other 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0075.wav We slot into a horrible jikaw puzzle that encourages us all to ignore and devalue consent our own and i and each other's 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0077.wav They are shamed in a very different way to men men are seen as disgusting animals 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0078.wav But that is presented as our natural states women who desire a scene as devien 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0079.wav The best stuff that i learn about sex came from my mother although since she doesn't have boundaries 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0081.wav For example she often told me that giving birth to her second son was the most sexual experience of her life 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0082.wav This made me feel pretty strange since i am her second child abut it also taught me something about some women's experiences 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0084.wav Her coming which is a useful thing to know and consider but possibly a questionable emphasis to be to be giving to an adolescent boy i think 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0085.wav Am this is the thing even with progressive and supportive parents 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0087.wav I don't think it's fair to say that when i was a tean agor 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0089.wav I knew that talking to all humans was pretty much the same thing but i didn't know how to talk to girls about desire 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0090.wav I didn't know how to negotiate romance to be honest i'm not sure i do now 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0091.wav If i'd had bare sex education 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0092.wav I'd have known that the idea of virginity is a weird one anyway 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0093.wav Sex isn't just when appenus goes into a virgina there are many ways to have sex 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0094.wav So i'd had sects before i officially lost my viginity 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0095.wav I was having sec at fifteen when me and my previous girl friend were messing around in my bed on enough for six months 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0097.wav I did a lot of things to her at which we both enjoyed but she didn't get me off 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0098.wav I was always confused about why and a few years later when drunker a night club 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0099.wav I asked her and she said that she didn't know either 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0101.wav Again this is i think down to the policing of hetrosexuality 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0102.wav Women i suppose to have sex but not want it and men i suppose to want sex all the time but only in a manly way 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0103.wav If you don't fit that manly modle then you have to push your sexuality down 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0104.wav The best piece of sex education my mum gave me was when i was five years old and myself and another boy of the same age were playing doctors and nurses with his sister and examining each other 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0105.wav Everything was cool and then suddenly it wasn't we'd overstepped a boundary and she was crying 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0106.wav I went to find my mum and tell her what was happening and she came and talke to us and explained the importance of consent and communication 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0107.wav She didn't shame any of us and because of that her lesson definitely had some in impact 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0109.wav I rape my girl friend because i did not know what rape was 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0110.wav Now i've cut it for time for this performance which is already a twelve minutes 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0111.wav I'm sorry to myself but i was sexually assaulted by a woman ah when i was younger and she didn't understand that i wasn't consenting 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0112.wav I don't have enough fingers to count the amount of people i know who are survivors 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0113.wav And that's just the people who have told me 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0114.wav Men don't talk to other men about rape and we certainly don't talk about consent 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0115.wav Men i know will have raped people men 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0116.wav You know will av raped people rapists aren't monsters 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0117.wav They are humans and generally speaking they are men 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0118.wav Why do more men rape 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0119.wav I think it's because of the power dynamics 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0120.wav We currently have and because we have a culture that is supporteve of rape 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0121.wav Men are statistically more likely to be raped by a man than a woman and when they are raped by women 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0122.wav They are less likely to see it as rape and so less likely to report it 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0123.wav Rape like other forms of violence is a power issue not a gender issue 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0124.wav There are survivors of all genders and there are abusers of all gendes 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0126.wav Is there when it isn't talking about consent more and finding ways to articulate our desires more will help us get rid of these mistakes 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0127.wav An a culture of blurred lines encourages and forgives abuse men need to talk to each other and call each other out when we perpetuate rape culture 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0128.wav We needs to make it clear to our peers that it is not socially acceptable to rape that there are more kinds of rape than evil 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0129.wav Monster rape that the medior tells us to be scared of and that we can be raped by men that we can be raped by women and that nice guies do rape

MSP-PODCAST_1908_1020.wav Yather y go and so you and i know each o 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1021.wav Ther we actually wemeant met for the first time in person this week end but 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1024.wav And the project is called let's talk big coin very appropriate for the big coin twenty thirteen conference where we are live on location rate 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1025.wav Es yes so let's talk bitcoin is a twice weekly show about all things bitquenrelat 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1026.wav Did how did you get the idea to do a show like this 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1027.wav Well you know my background is marketing my background of sails and my hobby background has alway been podcasts 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1028.wav Know i've been doing parcast ince two thousand five and what was your previous parkcast a ha ha 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1032.wav Cup i want to technical school to be an audio engineer and eventually dropped out of that 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1035.wav S that i really enjoyed first of hearing the sound of my own voice but 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1038.wav Value it i mean really that's o that's that' hat that's what it comes down to i'm it's 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1039.wav It's easy to make a vidio gamepodgastand so that's what i did i was very interesting viddyagains 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1041.wav Ually audy engineering so it was a natural transition for me to move into this space a where i was doin 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1042.wav In et all we did it we did a weekly shell for about four years 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1043.wav And eventually transition to vidio and then actually blew up kind of badly but you know that's how towtell these things go sometimes 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1050.wav Ya i think our gamers are a natural fit for bigquain minin 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1052.wav Ye hides gout of a natural transitio 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1053.wav And but no what what would let's talk wick coin is is a twice weekly show that basely talks about the ideas 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1054.wav The people and the projects that those ideas and people are powering that's where from 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1055.wav Me the really interesting stuff on bicwin comes in to play because you know you can focus on the price an 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1057.wav On't you kind of get past the obvious stuff 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1058.wav Then there are all of these insane things that are possible with be when and they just aren't possible with any other thing else and so that 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1069.wav Ah that's you know that that is what we've been hearing here i i's really flattering beuse that is the point of what i'm trying to do 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1070.wav What i review my role in all of this is as some one who has an understanding of technical issues but 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1071.wav E really has the just i just have the particular skill set to be able to ask the dumb questions you know that 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1072.wav Maybe somebody might be embarrassed to ask a i'm not embarrassed ask an i under 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1074.wav A absolutely you introduce yourself on the show as i like to explain complicated topics in a way that people can understand and y 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1076.wav Ying to you know again it's still a complicated topic so even when i explain it 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1077.wav Know you still have to have it's all a 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1078.wav Oud contact so in ow your listenership is probably really well suited because they understand how our monitary system is kind of broken 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1079.wav Butter a lot of people don't appreciate that and if they don't appreciate that it's very hard for them to kind of understand why bicuone would even be something worth their time 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1081.wav Eh ye i mean you'r gin hear at least one person whois f on libertarian on the chae eh that's f 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1082.wav Ine i think that you know any view that you ant to take is is incredibly appropriate in real 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1084.wav Iming from the perspective of i want to be left 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1085.wav Alone and i really want to leave other people alone if they're not doing something that is that that 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1090.wav Olitical side it's very difficult for me to identify myself as tiat because i do not agree with what thelibertarian party does in most senses 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1093.wav An yere  for the prospective i am 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1094.wav Fiskily conservative and socially very liberal 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1095.wav Yet doesn't sellica conservative to me but 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1100.wav As that so that's opdated del 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1101.wav Y it's daily yow yow with that project what we did its basically it up 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1104.wav Pull's content from all the best sights that are talking u biccoin and doing really the innovative stuff i have an ed 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1106.wav That's his entire focus with the project and he basily reads everything on the inner net about a about a you know 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1107.wav Id coin and then takes that and features it there and so is something 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1117.wav Like uyeh absolutely so i let's talk that coin and it's a vailble one 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1118.wav No i tune sound cloud um what else was i going to say about let's talk 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1121.wav Well ou know it's a funny store i actually met a something of a personal hero here ah jeoffrey pau 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1123.wav On the innernets ah h he did 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1124.wav Talk at a at c c c which is it which is a conference that happens every year in germany

MSP-PODCAST_1908_1129.wav Cally talked about a different types of of money that was sort of outside of the existing system and so that 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1130.wav Ind a broke something in my head i just tapped my head ah you know a 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1132.wav Oh there's an alternative uh you know 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1134.wav But it's another thing entirely to be able to look at the system and say the system is broken 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1135.wav Ut here's something better than we can actually do and it's very easy to move to it so 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1136.wav For me i mean that that was the start of my journey and it took me several years to get to the point where i'm here 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1137.wav But ultimately that was what' 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1141.wav The time biquan was very speculate adventure and ra 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1142.wav An ot something that really had much of a chance of picking up so did you immediately gravitate toward bit coin or was it

MSP-PODCAST_1908_1824.wav So oqe you have made these a 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1825.wav Okens that theyare their physical bicquins tel 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1849.wav Ou're telling me thit there's an online virtual currency in and here you go here's this 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1853.wav Ut it was a gorgeous design so i shallknow it's a cool thing and thati very quickly learn that there's like a 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1857.wav Am you know i think that's a really cool way to like introduce somebody to bit coin and have an easy and beautiful way to present the idea 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1859.wav You did you design it or did you contract that out 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1864.wav One should look like and they did that for the very purpose of ino having people used that idea to promote bicquin as a as a bicquin graphic ye 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1869.wav And you know i think the casaceous coins 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1870.wav Are one of the things that led to this idea that bit coin is like 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1873.wav That were that are often pictured when you see like a a news article about bicoin like there of often be like a pile of casaceous coins and they're all gold and so 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1874.wav People start to associate bitcorn with gold and then then you have light coins come out and and then 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1875.wav Their logo is silver with a little ell like just like the bicoin bee and then 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1877.wav The marketing for these different pines gets associated with the different metals did 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1890.wav You know yeh would you ever consider doing this with other alt coins like making a silver piece that has likewines on it or something 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1894.wav So i mean have you kind of step back from making their casacious 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1896.wav Like i noticed there were some changes to the webs ligkt 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1897.wav I dont know tell me what's going ouwt that 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1907.wav E that make sens basic economic principles 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1917.wav Ah that you're only sewing them for bitcoins 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1922.wav I know but you're only seldom for bit coins is that on purpose you ae 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1934.wav Is it just you or do you have a staff or well i don't help 
MSP-PODCAST_1908_1935.wav I have some help pit you have some frendzi 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0030.wav Bull i'd say maybe i'm the instigator but ta 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0032.wav Maker the conna connected the dots there but 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0042.wav Wel it's been great to have you guise on the nepworks i'm excited to sharis tm somesome of the stuff with you g 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0043.wav Yes which we've beenworking on for a long time talking about for a long time an f 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0044.wav Ind le were ready to to get into it so 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0055.wav Sure so yes o we did a lot o episode to let's tark bikuine i actually 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0057.wav I'm recorded right now with indrason stephanie and i talking about some of the stuff that's been happening over the last month while we've been on brake 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0058.wav But um but you're not wrong in that the show has gote harder to do both because the community that when we got started 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0059.wav Used to be really ou know a line used to be really kind of one entity has instead become really factionalized and i g 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0061.wav Is that people change as time goes on and that's been true for all the hosts onlet's tarkpicoin and it's also been true for basically everybody in the community 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0062.wav Like we all have the goals that we have for cripto currency and that we have for bit coin 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0063.wav And bitcoin hasn't necessarily behave to 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0066.wav Olic there's no simple answers to any of these things but the answers are getting progressively more complex 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0067.wav N different people benefit from kind of different pats forward for all f these things so i think that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0068.wav Ripto currency and bitcoin has become a lot more complicated since we started and at the beginning it was 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0069.wav Possible to kind of spend you know a couple of days a week or your entire life in some cases 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0070.wav Ah you know focussed on absorbing all the content but 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0072.wav Was a small enough amount of content out there and it was all relatively alined because the people who were interested wer 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0074.wav Over time that's really changed and instead it's become very factionalized and people have different interests 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0075.wav So from like andreusis perspective 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0076.wav He's now torring constantly so that both gives him a great perspective 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0077.wav It makes it hard for us to record because 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0078.wav Ike this last episode we recorded he was in a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0079.wav Apetown south africa i'm recording with us at ten o'clock at night 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0081.wav Ext episode wereging to do he's goingto be in mumbay 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0085.wav He's been all the heck over the place through a you knw a kind of tor 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0087.wav So there's that kind of difficulty that made it has made it just a little bit hard to do recordings from a technical standpoint 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0088.wav And then for stephane and i were both in really different places then we were when we got started with this 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0089.wav D for me it's because i moved and for stephanie 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0090.wav Because she didn't right stephanie's expectations have basically remained the same for cripto currency have basically remained the same for bitcoin because the stuff that she wanted from it the privacy 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0093.wav Kaneg got those at the beginning and they've become much less emphasized as time has gone on whereas for me 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0095.wav I've come to need to use the block chain and need to think about the block chain in fundamentally different ways than i did 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0096.wav When i was just uno speculating or i was just using it a personally as currency to do stuff 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0097.wav Im you know so so that's i think the thing that's changed is everything his 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0098.wav The bit coin is changed we've changed the shows changed the eqosystems changed back when we started doing the show like you said 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0099.wav We were ukno like i think athere was one show before us i'm called the bitquin show that had gone off the air about a three months before i started 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0101.wav And the rewards that you got from putting out an episode 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0103.wav Unified community this lacking content so it was 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0106.wav T an easier it's gotten harder because there's more com 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0107.wav Petition there's more interest there's more all of these things 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0108.wav So that's said un less sarkpicoin isn't going away un i'm 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0109.wav Ery pleased to say that i you know were 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0111.wav Where i think the show will be sustainable for at least a year and i hope far beyond that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0112.wav On we will be returning to a weekly shows a weekly episodes an we have some guests lined up im one of the ther things that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0113.wav Hat 's konde different about the later show compared to the earlier show is that we used to do all lot 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0114.wav Interviews with people who had u kno businesses and projects and stuff li 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0117.wav Thing happened it got really hard to do that because it wasn't just about talking o somene about their project any more 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0119.wav And that that was a position that i always felt very uncomfortable with 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0125.wav Iston to get everything back in order so that we can start again strong and duh 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0126.wav Now and keep doing this thing for a long time 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0144.wav Hope that the a the difference between the two is a more frequent reliable episodes 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0145.wav Less of me leaning on prerecorded stuffbecause just r 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0146.wav Ly that's what it's become i put myself into a situation where i've 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0147.wav Continued to try and do everything for the show and it's just to fail it's 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0148.wav Just like when i was not doing something else full time 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0150.wav And when i was doing something elsefull time for a while it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0153.wav Become completely impossible for me to do that i 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0154.wav Um yugais do a really great job of systemizing your show you've got like a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0155.wav Rocess and all of this stuff we continue to be after even three and a haf 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0156.wav Feurs four years completely seat of our pants 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0157.wav You know we pull somebody on there's no prept questions 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0160.wav We hadd it out a little bit of stov funo for like 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0163.wav It's a and so that's easy to do 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0164.wav If you're superplugged in 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0168.wav I'l work it on this other stuff and you kind of halfe to just block everything else out if you want to try and be 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0169.wav Active so you know over the last couple of years i have definitely shifted the balance in my life from kind of 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0170.wav Treating myself as a journalist on the one side treating myself as an anchipernore on the other side and the downside good good news bad news as i still retained the ethic 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0172.wav L have all the gilt complexes with helping people 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0173.wav Who are you note wind up then a betraying the trust and all that's 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0175.wav Acking the time to do that due diligence which 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0177.wav Just it's even like i wish we could i wish we had the ba 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0178.wav N with but it's just not what we've done and luckily shows on the network half picked up that slack for us 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0180.wav Such a such a bad thing that we had stopped doing that simply because it was creating opportunity for body else 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0185.wav Unknowingly ss just as big a problem it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0186.wav Ust has you know like you feel bad as opposed to your a bad person a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0187.wav But you know ultimately enabling any of it is still a net negative for everybody and i think we've seen this from the amount of projects that are 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0189.wav Actuall you know especially through the crypto currency stuff but have 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0193.wav Light coin was for a long time in feather coin too where for a long time the 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0194.wav Most inovative crypto currencies out there besides bitcoin 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0195.wav Cause they solve the problem of 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0196.wav Ding transaction sizes even lower than bitcoin was able to with more numbers of tokens 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0197.wav Something like this is not different where we are now right 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0198.wav It's just that the the pitch has gott a little bit more sophisticated instead of saying oh while the problem here 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0199.wav As the biccuonlees twenty one million tokens while feathercoin has twenty one billion tokens 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0200.wav Now they're saying oh well the problem now is that you kn 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0205.wav Ajesper an article 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0206.wav The way that you make money right down cripto currency is you pick a large verticle right that has 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0207.wav Om a block chain opportunity associated with it and you don't actually try to solve the pro 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0209.wav At then somebody else who wants to solve the problem can build on top of and do that and that's a great thing to do because then success 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0210.wav Not yourproblem  all you had to do all you told people you wuld 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0211.wav O is just build out the underlying rails and it's not your problem and it's not your fault if nobody then comes and builds on it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0214.wav An iceo but we did run into and go through all of that same stuff we're not actually building any block 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0215.wav Hains were just using blockchings even we found that when you just build the infer structure 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0216.wav Nobody cares because the people who are big enough to actually have a problem that could be solved by the infstructure 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0217.wav Don't want to be first movers and the people who are too small to be really useful to you know 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0218.wav The infer structure but who like the idea are the wrong people to make it successful and so you wind up 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0219.wav Tthi chicke eggproblem or even after you bildthe infrstructure it'sstillnotan 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0220.wav Ough because nobody who is worth moving first 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0221.wav Is going to move first and so that's where i've a project little later i'll talk to you about 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0222.wav Thata is our attempt to solve that problem using tokens 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0224.wav T just in general it's gotten so much harder to a winnow through the content because the people who are in the space now 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0227.wav On to start a company and o patenting and monotizing that ostume idea 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0229.wav Y want to patent anything everybody was you know superinto the open source thing while everthelast 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0230.wav You know year or so it's got much more competitive at the application layr 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0254.wav As a financial vehicle igree with you i think that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0255.wav Um cripto currencies kill or used case so far has been bitcoin vallue transverse 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0256.wav Um and there are a lot of other interesting use cases out there and speculation i 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0257.wav Man like to be totally clear speculation is what really drives a lot of the th 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0258.wav Alyo transfer usecase at all um but that's o k because once you have m 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0259.wav Anne you can do other stuff with it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0260.wav So i really know what the killer application is i 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0261.wav Think that we're on the right path with the token stuff that were working on and i like i set him happy 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0264.wav S that anybody who tells you that they know is totally lying because even if you're working on something like you might hope that it's the killer application but 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0266.wav Here's no use case for cripto currency that actually has any sort of meaningful number of users besides the speculative value transfer thing 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0268.wav Hope that ah we change that and other companies out there change that by 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0269.wav By creating applications that rather than trying to be 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0270.wav Ike elegant technical solutions are practical real world solutions that use criptocurrency in places where it really adds a lot of value 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0271.wav But they don't force people into the egosystem for ideological reasons basically because at least in our ex 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0272.wav Rience we've seen  one you try to do that you los 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0274.wav So you donl like you want 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0276.wav Ou want people for whom it presents a better option 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0277.wav Because that's how you actually get real people to use this not by sa 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0280.wav But buy it now because it'll be worth more or later even though it's at all at near all time highs right 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0281.wav Stead it's just the most convenient thing for them to use and so they just use it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0282.wav And that accomplishes the same goal but instead of having the argument about why this is valuable from these technical and monitor 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0283.wav Your reasons instead you just say this is useful usicause it's a product 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0284.wav So that's the strategy were taking 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0322.wav Um the thing that we didn't know when we started eltie bee coin and that became increasingly obvious over time there were two things 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0323.wav One is that if you give away something for free um then you create a kind of problem for it right 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0324.wav Where unless you have a lot of money ah just kind of sittin there waiting to make it valuable 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0325.wav Then it has to become valuable for other reasons than putting money into it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0329.wav We if the nepwork was selling a lot of advertisements 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0330.wav Ah you know if the netbrk had been able to effectivally help pod cast monotizs in things like that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0331.wav Than we could have seen an egosystem start that would have recirculated that back into it and you could have seen a really functional system but 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0333.wav Actually m we didn't really have the ability to do that and now 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0337.wav In the kind of life cycle of tokens built on bitcoin 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0339.wav Their services out there which existed so this is what led to essentialate the creation of tokenly 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0340.wav Am was creatin the vending machine and we had an auction machine m 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0341.wav Kind of up front thay would allow people to un bid with elle be coined um in a live auction format on a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0345.wav The people who were willing to play the game were not the people who actually wanted to buy the advertisements 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0346.wav Humandd e people who wanted b  advertisement 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0348.wav Likeprice was cheaper if they went through te auction or if they could get a belt 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0349.wav Bonus by using alty beecoin like they just wanted a predictable price that they could pay with money that they understood and 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0352.wav To to learn the system but everybody else and a lot of those people were people who we really needed to make the system work in a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0353.wav Economical way i were not willing to use the system just because again it was so new and because it was very different from what they had done before 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0354.wav So that was a big prom with el t beecoin and then the other probably ran into is that different people 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0356.wav Pecially mas it became worth less in a in later 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0358.wav And as the value bicon went up price vell to bakuon went down 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0360.wav A weekly elti bequoin distribution and so even if it just like a buch 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0364.wav L just hold on to these casentna acually care about that much money but some f 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0365.wav Y from indonesia has basically a huge inscentive because their cost of living is so different 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0366.wav To take that dollar worth of eltibe coin go to the exchange and sell the eltibe coin for 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0367.wav R auno bit coin which they then convert into their local currency and actually make a decent amount 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0371.wav Aking the token useful ah secondly ah the people who were 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0373.wav Inthe gamtechnalogically but didn nactually have the money or products that they wanted to spon 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0378.wav Ye yes yet yet actually it was te it was very interesting what we saw o'm one of the the the real data points that we pulled out of the eltibeequin system 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0379.wav Was a large increase and user counts from indunesia from russia from a ucr 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0380.wav Ain on therea a whole bunch of places a in kind of like eastern europe in asia 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0381.wav I'm were the audience just went away the heck up and you noticed it in comments too because there would be people like asking for you to spell the magic word 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0382.wav Ah because they didn't speak english 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0385.wav An and i like on the in the way that you described it there i agree 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0387.wav That you no allows people to actually monotize its a real use case 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0391.wav There's no incentive for them to go out and buy it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0392.wav Um and that was the problem is that what wines up happening as you get this spiral were the people who are 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0393.wav Economically incentivice to sell it go to the market sell it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0394.wav This pushes down the price adds more or supply it to the available that's amount a you know the amount that's failable on the market 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0396.wav The same time  the  people who might want a buyit under normal circumstances are probably alr 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0397.wav Eaty getting it forfree andey don't have an incenter to sel 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0398.wav So they're just banking in every week over time 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0399.wav Feeling good about that and so what happenes is that this pushes the price down because you have buyers who are satisfied and s 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0400.wav Ellers who are always ready to sell because they 're happy with the money that they 're getting even of its very small 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0401.wav And so threw that dynamic over the course of about a year and a half 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0403.wav Icoinget pushed own very substantially and you could see it because every time we would do a saturday distribution yo 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0405.wav So i think that from you know like a experiment 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0408.wav And also you know like it's not over yet 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0410.wav Didn't actually stop doing magic word 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0412.wav Ing out the reward's programme so that was another experiment actually to see 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0413.wav You know kind of like what happens do people still do the magic word if you aren't paying them you know else you becoin 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0414.wav Even though elti beecoin is basically worth nothing at this point on the amount they were giving out is absolutely tiny 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0415.wav And i think that we did see that even though theyre ale it something is still a better incentiviser than nothing 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0417.wav 'm cure i'd be curious to seeto know like how much of a dropyugar's experience since we did that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0428.wav It's a really cooel listening metric but it it's very interesting that yugeas experience such 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0429.wav O drop that's like that's like ano one twentieth of the people kept doing it a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0430.wav 's very interesting so anyways you know as it as an experiment eltie bee coin has been really fantastic im and it's taught us a lot about this 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0434.wav And i'm now it's time to do the next thing with it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0445.wav Ye i think the um like i said ah it's all about cre 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0446.wav Eating the opportunity for for frictionless economic activity to happen right you want a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0447.wav Make it so that people can do stuff that they want to do it when they want to do it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0448.wav Only first did this like the auctions for example you couldn't 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0451.wav And we at the time thought that this a essentially making it so eltibequin had a monopoly on our ego system 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0452.wav Would be in net positive because it would force people into doing this and in practi 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0456.wav So over time i've come to to recognize this and almost everything about my earlier opinions is that a being an ideological purist 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0457.wav Has advantages from an ego point of view and from a like i felt good about it ah and i felt like i was on the right side of things 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0458.wav But in practice i've seen that it causes so many more problems then ah then then that value is worth that ah 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0459.wav That yes soi think that is just another example of that so now 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0460.wav My suggestion is in continuons to be 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0461.wav That you accept every form of value that some one is willing to give you and if you want to have preferential pri 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0462.wav Saying then you give discounts for the stuff that you want yo now force people to do it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0463.wav Just give em the option and even then i don't think many people wind up taking it because again like theire's this 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0464.wav There's this training that has to happen right and and most of the people who are willing to do that training are not the same people who actually want to give you m 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0465.wav Oney or have no money to give you for things that are good 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0467.wav This amenites the same thing like advertisers are even worse than having guesss on right because they're paying you 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0468.wav Igt so like and i did an experiment o 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0471.wav And during the first part i mentioned during one of the kont i mentioned in the shownotes that and whan he was talking about to you don't bit 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0475.wav Eme hhe was our first sponsor right 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0478.wav And um and from that i got four or five comments ah from people it was about half the comments saying that you know like 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0480.wav Years ago ah that we couldn't really talk to him about this stuff 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0481.wav Because it was like we were conflicted and so like he had actually offered to sponsor the show with 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0482.wav Retty decent ia a decently large amount of 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0483.wav Oney im you know before we had done this stuff and i said no because i assumed that this 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0484.wav D be the case but it continues to be the case so that that relieves the problem is that the 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0485.wav People who have money to give you when it comes to advertising a lot of times are not projects that you actually want to advertise and there's this unfortunate 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0486.wav Ust reality that if a project is asc 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0487.wav Am that's effective right like it's not just an obvious gam 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0489.wav Then eh you won't be able to tell and b they'll actually have a lot of money to pay you to do whatever you're gong to do cause they're a scam 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0490.wav So they don't actually have many of the costs associated so we just wound up just 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0491.wav Completely walking away from advertising after a certain point and just no 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0496.wav Advertising continues to be very difficult for me just because of that disconnect between people who you want to advertise with you verses people who have the money to v 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0501.wav Um so the thing i've n workad on fo th last year and the end of life for let's talk bick coin 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0505.wav Ycoin there will be an exchange opportunity 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0506.wav I'm into a project that i've been consulting on it's a reinvention of a proof of existence i'm in a method that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0509.wav Anges can happen but this is all part of essentially the eltibi nepwork being acquired by 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0510.wav Abitisi media dot org on which is the parent company of bittuin magazine and thpparent company of wi bit coin an parent company of i beli 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0511.wav Evea a chinese a publication as 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0514.wav I'm continuing do the less orpoquent show that continues to be entirely my thing 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0515.wav But what's happening here effectively is i've been working with david bailey im whos the a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0516.wav Founder of a bicisi mediadarorg 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0517.wav And who's been a long time fan of the showan network and 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0518.wav As you goes kno i dun really intend to start a network i i thou 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0520.wav Winter of twenty thirteen am enda conna early twenty w 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0521.wav Ourteen on we thought that the bubble that we were in at the time 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0522.wav Which was to thirteen hundred had changed the dynamic of things and that it was going to be even easier than it had before to monotize and so we could bring in 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0524.wav It was never in area that i actually had any personal success in and in general we try to 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0525.wav Couple of times we hired a a team 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0526.wav Um enda can i try to make the nepwork useful because that really what i wanted from it was to not have to focus 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0527.wav On monotizing the podcasts i just wanted to focus on making the podcast on having the resources teuna like having editor constantly and have a producer on the show 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0529.wav And the i just was never able to make a work because that's not my skillset and i was trying to do too many things at once 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0530.wav So um essentially for 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0531.wav Last year i've been talking with david bailey 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0532.wav I'm about whether or not and how we can work together 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0533.wav M in order to make it so that they can bring a lot of the success that they have had in monotizing and creating a sustainable enterprise with biqui magazine 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0534.wav Was a pretty much a basket case before they bought it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0535.wav Am and a you now and other things essentially 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0536.wav I'm to make it so that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0537.wav Ah you know we all have the resources to  do this and most importantl 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0538.wav So that the nepwork rather than being just kind of light 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0540.wav Is what it's been to this point um you know 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0542.wav O pushing forward growing the audience useful structure for all the podcass and podcasters that are on it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0543.wav D that was always the promi that we had is just that in a li 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0547.wav Frankly have a lot of money to do it i'm and got very poor results as a as a results 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0549.wav Ig infusion of money and resources into the nepwork 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0550.wav At will then go towards growing a the audiences of the podcastes towards improving monatization and making it so that this can be a sustainable thing for everybody 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0551.wav I mention that the name is changing towards the beginning of this episode maybe that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0553.wav Basily what this is is em the nepwork is going to be a in about three or four months rebranded and relaunched 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0555.wav And we're going to see it expands beyond juscriptive currency and into basely all desruptive technology 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0556.wav Um there's a lot of other stuff 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0557.wav A a i i'm very excited about it like i said there's goingt be a lot of resources coming into im into the nepwork 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0559.wav The show i am very excited to have kind of some more stability in a more professional organization behind us 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0560.wav Two a to make this next jump s 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0561.wav That's that's the thing that i was really waiting on is he was just killin me added ing the showes kil 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0562.wav Lummy editing and producing the show and we are just putting out worse and worse content and i really hate that i hate putting out stuff that's loquality and i n 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0564.wav So um so this is an opportunity for me um and everybody else'll be contacted with the next a couple of weeks 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0565.wav M buy the management to you don't go through this whole process that weve been going through as wel 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0567.wav Im but yet that's that's basely where we are right now is im the eltiby nepwork is going to be rebranded as let's talk 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0568.wav Ah wi've been acquired by btisimedia 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0571.wav That's not exactly certain 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0572.wav This point soap that's that's long and the short of what's happening therer happen t answer in questions 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0580.wav So content producers on the nepwork are going to be umcontacted by both myself and on the essentially the team that'll be running at davibily 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0581.wav Ce not conbe running at to essentially go through a negotiation process to figure out what types of servic 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0583.wav Ming you guise are kind of like on the extreme end of the spectruwhere you're doing a good show by yourself your advert 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0584.wav Ising and you know doing the monatization and have something that at least from the outside seems sustainable 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0585.wav So youguis probably will need less service from the network than most people 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0586.wav Ut i've talked with a lot of the other podcaster 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0587.wav S who like me have been struggling to really keep producing good quality content on a regular basis and not really 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0588.wav Having much success with the monartization and for them again like that's what this is um so they'll they'll probably wind up with 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0589.wav He squime l different for everybody but the bottom line 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0590.wav Is is that things will be getting settled i'm in the you know 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0591.wav Ext couple of weeks there can be no changes i'm  the nepwork you w 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0593.wav I'm we'll see a relaunch of the platform i'm with a some of th new branding and i'm with  the other thing that's happening here is that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0594.wav A the eltibi nepwork has been receiving requests to join the nepwork and has been saying were closed for almost a year 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0595.wav The only reason cripto a the only reason the cripto show mad it on was because they literally bothered me so many times 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0596.wav T  was just like ok fine we'll put your guises on early ut i'm still i 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0597.wav Thisin this negotiation so 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0598.wav Oh so things might change after a certain point buyere 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0602.wav Um that kantagoes beyond what's being offered right now on the nep 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0606.wav Weregoing to take in pilots and to hopefully put on a lot of stuff u but some of the more exciting things from my perspective are 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0608.wav Bitisi media dar org folks  and or 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0610.wav I'm back in twenty thirteen we put together a pilot with juanjanos and 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0611.wav Dolpho from the a argentinian um bitquoin embassy 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0612.wav Ah and a one other gentleman whose name escapes me wu pu 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0613.wav Together a pilot episode of hoblemos bitcoin 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0614.wav Which was a let's talk bichoin and spanish 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0616.wav Banish so i wound up just kind of bang in my head against that wall for about 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0617.wav O days and then we get or contor moved on and 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0618.wav Moved on but but i think there is a huge opportunity and an increasing opportunity to have a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0619.wav Hose that are targeted at the chinese market that are targeted towards minors specifically and focus on that type of news 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0620.wav And really to kind of go really niche on a lot of these things i'm like i think there were probably on a wine of having o show entirely on licensing 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0623.wav I'm called thinking with tokens um that is basically 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0625.wav You know a panel of people you have somebody on who has a project that they want to talk about in contect of tokens and you can o just go through the whole thing and l 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0626.wav Ay out the system and just going to get the ideas flowing because that's been the real problem that we continue to see is that 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0627.wav Pople do't know how to think about the stuff andthey don't really know what it's good for and they just conare like 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0628.wav E you could use tokens or smart contracts or another example 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0629.wav You can use smart contracts for that without really thinking 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0630.wav Is a smart contract a good vehicle for this or as it just something i can technically do 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0632.wav Stuff but not a lot of their good use stuff 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0638.wav Ng is that with resources everything gets so much easier i ass 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0647.wav Tryne work that tat's bt that's basically the idea here on and's the other thing that's very importance h 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0648.wav It was one of the real reasons that kicke me over the edge to do this virst as not is that the marketability of a ashoz a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0649.wav Ub like advertising i'm gets m 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0650.wav Uch much much better at ten thousand listeners per episode and basically all our shows 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0651.wav Am including you know let's trike biquoin and i 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0652.wav Ugas too on like you occasionally will get a show above ten thousan 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0653.wav Listens if something goes a little bit viral some place 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0654.wav But the vast majority of episodes are in like the for to six thousand range so the 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0655.wav Re's kind of a necessary growth that has to happen for all the shows in order to 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0656.wav Om in order for to actually make economic sense for them to do this so again the commitment from their perspective is they have to get these shows to a to th 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0657.wav At and so they re they are very incentive eyed to advertise and very incentiviced to do kind of all these other things 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0658.wav Ecause it makes the network much more marketable to people who would advertise with it 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0659.wav So you know so helpfully aha ha ha h luse 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0662.wav And ti kno i i didn't actually talk to anybody 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0663.wav But david bailey i am he was really the only person who i felt like 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0664.wav You know a kind of groct what i was trying to do with this and could also help us with the business development side that i had personally had my failings in 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0665.wav Um so yet so i'm like 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0666.wav I said i iy of high hopes for the nepwork i 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0691.wav Did an equity crowd sail on the bank to the future platform i'm i with great help from simon dixen over there who i know you gause have talked to 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0692.wav Bonline as we rase some money over there im on the idea of taking and connecting cripto currency and crowd funding 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0694.wav On which we have seen become very prominent but in the actual traditional rewardspase crowd funding type of space 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0695.wav And the argument behind that is basically that rewardsbase crowd funding has a meaningful problem with refunds i'm weare basically i 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0696.wav I back something on a crowd funding platform that money and it's successfully funds that money then goes to the 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0697.wav A person who's going to do the project and they spend the money doing the project and then at the end i i get my thing 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0698.wav But the problem is is that a without token 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0700.wav Is a promise from the person i from the person who's can ado it and the probl with that promise is that it's not transferable 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0701.wav It's not a tangible thing that i can actually do what i want with i just have to kind of weight 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0702.wav And then it's a it's a marker being kept on their side that tells them that i am owed one of these things bu 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0703.wav T if in the middle of this project a 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0704.wav Ike for example you know iva student loane i'm right that i really need to pay and this wi 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0706.wav Able now so i need to get a refund in order to pay this uno student long payment the superimportance 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0707.wav A what do you do there and the answer right now is you complain to the person that operates the p 
MSP-PODCAST_1909_0708.wav Oject and they basically have nothing that they can do ab
