MSP-PODCAST_0779_0374.wav That it was all kind of control and and gana once again this is exactly what you are addressing you knw you've kond of solved you solved the bowee problem maybe we should be shoul put that in your marketing 
MSP-PODCAST_0779_0408.wav Coun to get in o eta really it at i guess at a low price a to be able to take advantage of that platform as its coming and this is the thing too as i see it is that like a lot of the stuff youna
