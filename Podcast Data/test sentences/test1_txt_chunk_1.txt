MSP-PODCAST_0133_0870.wav This is a good time because this this the first time alex that the kinds of things you when i have been talking about and i knew you even go back before i do ecause you were one of the folks who help wake me up back in nineteen ninety nine when i became an advocate 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0871.wav Sho you know those of us wha've been shaying this for over a decade 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0873.wav Hey all of you out there who are concerned about this this is what we've been talking about all along and wake up and they're waking up in in droves 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0874.wav So you know this whole guggle thing and is as your listers probably know i work with start page starpage dock hon which is the private alternative to gogle 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0883.wav And youknow you put all that together in your socase so we are creating essentially and you and ive talked about this before in the show 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0888.wav An the things that ultimately are going to be caught in that are us 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0895.wav And so he came up with his disposable concept that now has polluted our whole arwhle planage 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0899.wav And went when i was looking at that i was singing well so that's walmard 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0900.wav You kow back an eighteen ninety six this jelette gai was predicting walmart 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0902.wav Because it's the same concept you've got in the same way that walmart is like how people buy stuff nowadays and has the power to snuff out of their companies and eliminate competition 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0907.wav You know i remember back of the nineties when i was a graduate student t harvard 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0908.wav And we were like the first people to ever use the internet it was new it was not graphical it was all text it was no hard to navigate and were like how cool 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0959.wav It can be so easy to just say ah it's it's too much we can't fight back there's nothing we can do 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0966.wav I i encourage people not to give up and not to lose heart because there are projects that people have been working on for ou kno three four years and they say it's not getting anywhere when it getting any traction 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0967.wav And then you look up and you go await a minute woo thinks are changing 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0968.wav So don't don't lose hope and i think the key thing and this is why i think the innernet is were this whole fight really comes together you 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0970.wav But where wa where the crock really is is this internat this ability to communicate because if they can shut that off 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0972.wav If we can't communicate with each other at that point than anything they want to do is going to be duable 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0980.wav And everybody all of a sudden started tiping and time's new roman twelve point fonc like overnight 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0982.wav Because those were the default settings and this is kind of a phrase that i use a lot just just in my own work as i think 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0985.wav And then you go and you go to your college or your whatever job and then you retire and you pay your taxes and that's the end of you 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0986.wav And and meanwhile you are being watched controlled menipulated and used 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_0988.wav Let's home school our kids let's out you know let's take an alternative way of getting through the education system let's take an alternative way of finding out information 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1028.wav That wait a minute so there is a power game going on and we can use the innernetch to stop something that seems more powerf 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1036.wav Well and this is why i i i got a couple of things i want to recommend people use cash use it or lose it 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1037.wav Because coush is your only anonymous payment method and not only anonymous becase e lobules aloud care people know what i buy doesn't matter 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1045.wav And using it to say you are over weight or you have high blood pressure in so you cannot buy these particular items 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1053.wav If you're doing all of your purchasing on the line instead of actually going to real stores brick in mortar and supporting local businesses if you're going a walmart every time you need to fill your shopping cart 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1056.wav And we've got to be in mass and i know enough people listen to your programme that even if just we did this we'd have a massive impact cause you know i drive up and down the freeways by the way and nou hamshire 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1060.wav Eenif i have to pay more you kow everybody always has open everything's so cheap at walmart i see how cheap is your freedom how much you willing to sell that for 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1062.wav Consciously aware with total awareness that i'm spending more and i i viewed at fifty cents as me putting money to fund the things i believe 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1067.wav Is is those little sails they may seem little to us but their imessive part of the economy 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1068.wav And those guies want everything and it's the greet factor i want everything you know guga wants all the searches and all the fone calls and all of the everythings 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1069.wav And you know by the way i shouldn't single ab gruggle because that's cunning ot faritsles or yawhu it is hot mal 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1102.wav And again you know our parents didn't know that an our grand parents didn't know it they saw walter croncried on the evening news and it was gospel 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1103.wav So that's my point yen what is changed that in what is created this window for us to know this 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1105.wav This is like this is like unprecedent it people always believe the propagand except for a tiny teany little minority 
MSP-PODCAST_0133_1106.wav And now you've got the majority getting it and they get it because of the internet which is wether scrambling so much to shut it

MSP-PODCAST_0147_0003.wav Or at least prism anyway i'm not going to talk about ah that that seems to be the thing talked about all over the place and so really there's no need for me to rehash it

MSP-PODCAST_0147_0049.wav Computer shopper another defunct title offered a warehouseful of gear that a tect loving father and son team could build on the kitchen table

MSP-PODCAST_0147_0081.wav A like like a book o kate like like a full on book now granted this would be half more to do with the kindle a but we're not talking about the kindle hearers were saying the inner net killed the magazine 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0089.wav But i mean man you know so so that kind of it depends on the content thethere's continant there that makes perfect sense to have it on the inernet and for it to work 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0096.wav You know it's not necessary and i don't think it's dying you nown it just like i don't think the paper backs really dying

MSP-PODCAST_0147_0197.wav But you know i'm admittedly you know i am in afor for lack of a better phrase and i don't like this hrasing but for lack of a better phrase i am

MSP-PODCAST_0147_0201.wav A msaudy arabia is kind of a pet topic of mine because even when i wasn't an anarchist and i was a 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0202.wav A du no i guess may be even of a conservative bent you could say i never understood why we were friends with sawdy arabia 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0203.wav Esan we the united states aas at the time i considered myself an american i no longer do so 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0204.wav I mean just straight up soudy arabia at that time in my opinion was the most 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0205.wav And if i eno wanted to keep these kind of opinions erf you know i i like this kind of a language i provice still would 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0206.wav A i still say this but sod arabia is was the most evil country on planet earth 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0207.wav And yet the united states is the best of friends

MSP-PODCAST_0147_0211.wav And we post up pictures on the cover of popular magazines of a woman with her thumb being inked because she voted aand yet 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0212.wav You know endand we're so proud of that when we're in y reck and yet when you look at sod eurabia and women can't even drive on the roads

MSP-PODCAST_0147_0228.wav And of assisting and encouraging these calls in corresponding with face book pages followers and concealing them according to human rights watch 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0229.wav Again let me make this statement this isn't the main point i really want to make itwit with this country but i i can't repeat this enough and if you're ever in conversation 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0230.wav With you know people that are of a political persuasion a that isn't say libertarian 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0231.wav This is just an easy way to to get them to start thinking 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0232.wav I feel because you just bring up i mean just just quote that well they're breaking allegiance with the king 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0233.wav That's what america was founded on supposedly was breaking allegiance with the king why aren't we supporting these guyes 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0234.wav Ou now who's to say they were even trying to break allegiance with the king maybe maybe they don't mind their king they just wanted a little more free thought in something there's ye know there's nothing in these articles about it what exactly they were sang 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0235.wav You know i'm sure the sauty rabian government pryze said facebook you need to take the stuff down and face wok probably agreed twitter would ave done the same thing apparently recently a but anyway 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0236.wav Breaking llegiance with the king and we hold hands and were o k with with the sat witsadi arabia like their an ally 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0237.wav Anyway all of the accused were convicted of breaking a saudy law titled the anti cibre crime law 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0238.wav Which deems it legal to produce send or store material in an information network that could harm public order 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0240.wav The seven men reportedly admitted to using certain act of espace book pages but they also said they didn't realize it was illegal 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0241.wav Soud arabia is known for having a low tolerance for on line activity 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0242.wav In two thousand ten the government reportedly blocked face book because it didn't conform to the country's conservative values 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0243.wav And last year well known blager hamza cachgari was detained for writing an imaginary conversation with the prophet muhammed on twitter 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0244.wav Ike  i'm wen' ave to look for that cause i bet that was so good a most recently in march the government threatened to block several popular internet chat 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0245.wav All and messaging services including skipe what zap and vibre the government said that these services warrant in line with the country's regulatory requirements 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0246.wav Am i'm just goingto hit the point home one more time 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0247.wav Why is the united states government why why are they friends of them not just the united states government why are guised like john heggy supportive 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0248.wav If you don't know who john haggy is he's a pastor or very popular tellof angelist pastor am why is john haggy 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0249.wav So against i ran saying that we need to attack i ran first we need to do a preentive strike against i ran and you can read the stuff i've read all haggy's books i know what i'm talking about 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0250.wav 'm not just making like blind attacks yen i've read the defence of israel ive read jerusalem count on i'e read a a financial arm again and i've read all those 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0251.wav Anyway why does john haggy say what nuts souty rabias all right 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0252.wav He means saty arabias all right iran's not even doing half the stuff the saty arabia is doing 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0253.wav I mean they're doing a lot of it make no mistake 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0254.wav So so we got seven guies in prison for just about two years for posting on face 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0255.wav I mean d chew on that v how and why you know it blows my mind 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0256.wav Im im i really wish that mark zuckeberg would come out and make a statement and say nigt you don't t look look 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0257.wav I made this so that people can have the freedom to express themselves 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0258.wav And i can't believe these seven guies ar e nar in prison here you know here's so many millions o dollars get them out of their 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0259.wav I will not have people in prison for using my service 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0260.wav Yes zuckeberg or ser or sanberg either one of them should have came out and said something like that there should have been a statement about that 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0261.wav Ah because it's very very clear and in the legality of this that it's because they were using facebook in particular there's no questions about that 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0262.wav It's because they were using face book and they should have came out eno zurkerburg or sanbrg should have came out and made a statement saying no 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0263.wav How much do you want will let them go or i'll get i'l i'll make them into mexicin or american citizens do something but you know what 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0264.wav And i contest this personally you put up some pictures of meter maids and bichines 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0265.wav Or of people with cancer cancer survivors who have done tremendous things with their body after the ca 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0266.wav Beautiful things of their body after ah you know tragic aevents after having cancer 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0267.wav You post that stuff man face book says no ah ye you're offending people you got ta go 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0268.wav So you know i think facebook doesn't mind that seven guides are in prison 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0269.wav For two years for posting probably very freethought stuff 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0270.wav And there is nowhere like there is nowhere in the in in the statements an in you know in the cort orders are whatever out of soty ravia that says that 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0271.wav They were inciting people to violence 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0273.wav So what so that they wanted to assemble you know illegal gatherings don't you knowae that means i'm scared to find out what it means 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0274.wav But again you know that this is this is where people it's it's it's set such a mind fuck 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0275.wav That you know the innernet yes te freedom of speech on the inernet you know stop sopa and pippa in all that 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0276.wav And yet nobody  i mai i'll blame them all i'll blame every every internett company wicky pedia all those people that were against sopa and peppa 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0277.wav About they make a statement against the sat arabian government for throwing people in jail because what 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0278.wav Because they they wanted freedom of expression how about lets have wicky pedy to go black for that 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0279.wav Ut no they were probably just too busy sant well in england and the united states everything's fine so who cares those other people aren't human anyway 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0280.wav And if they've an iapologize if jimmy wales or if if zuc 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0281.wav Or sanberg or anybody has already made these statements state that they've actually made the satements ov er talking about bolemitalia 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0308.wav Soja just so you are aware ah this is something this is interesting

MSP-PODCAST_0147_0623.wav A journalist is not allowed to protect his work and his sources from government agents

MSP-PODCAST_0147_0726.wav You know like that it could be more and and what i mean by that is like ocase have this pilgrim' story line with these mutations 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0727.wav And you know you could have just just this tremendous story could have come out of that 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0744.wav And that's what i'm sort of waiting for with power rangers 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0748.wav So we felt kind of weird about that but we went there to see it because in the trailer for in the preview for for power rangers turbau the movi 
MSP-PODCAST_0147_0753.wav That like all this could be really epic like che's evil who knows what she would do in allisto so that's what i like about power angers 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0060.wav When i go into super market i see employ of the month and i think i hope they at least get a good parking's face out of it

MSP-PODCAST_0167_0124.wav Iy's raiot it's a literal interpretation of that were like they dont it's all mut did you see the mazely brothers the big edian little ety 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0128.wav Um synthian nixim with udohagin  osaid hagin and she's like his hogin 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0130.wav Asn't he just died yes yes and i actually rented his apartment in the 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0132_0001.wav A years ago from him he had a tiny studio for writing that i rented up when i was doing greece on broadway 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0132_0002.wav And became friendly with him and that is one of my favorite documentars i think it's the best documentary kind of ever made it was the beginning of reality t v 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0133.wav Eate it created a whole new jonright both in journal 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0135.wav Yen an absolutely documentary fems and that they nursured all of these younger documentary filmakers who hopefully pronounced their names 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0142_0001.wav And mary louise wilson both who won the tonyaward for the performance 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0142_0002.wav It was stupendous it was almost like channeling not even acting 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0142_0003.wav And they both their singers and yo know there was an amazing book in a great score and i think anything christi neversoul does they should give her a tony 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0148.wav S just the problem with broadway it's like every single nerve gits ye are you're right i agree 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0152.wav Us m eno e to bout a athoriti experience for some 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0154.wav L but it's just so expensive that it's really hard to get to go tee omthing 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0155.wav Yes betcome really aledist and it's really sad im even you know i have a school here i 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0157_0001.wav But we get those kits to go to see broadway shows and sadly we've had to purchase all the tickets you know 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0157_0002.wav So a part of the cost of running this hule event is that these children who live in the theatre district and never get to see the shows right it's like being in hawaii living near the beach and never getting to go in 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0157_0003.wav Right so we get them to actually go see what it is that's going on in their neighborhood that the're ah you no living amonks but never getting to experience but we have to pay for them as well so it's 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0159.wav Astatable because here we are and it's thriving and things are really 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0161.wav The industry itself i don't think is set up to perpetuate its longevity 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0162.wav I apologis admeto interrupt you but i meant by unsustainables that if there is not a rosy odonal and place who happens to be a philanthropic those kids don't get to go to the thea

MSP-PODCAST_0167_0164_0001.wav Is really needed and i wish there could be more and we work wark work with the board of ead and we go into the most needy schools baste on free lunch 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0164_0002.wav So you know thereis definitely a need for art's programmes in in new york city and across the country and many states have asked us to replicate it but 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0164_0003.wav You know it's a specific in my opinion to new york and although we took the premiss and the prototype from jactemboisdante america 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0164_0004.wav Ah he's an amazing dancer inquirgapher who goes around the world teaching dance to 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0164_0005.wav You know people in appallacian mountains to you know people in other countries 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0164_0006.wav We took what he did and we replicated it only changed it to musical theatre not just dance 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0165.wav 'm so glad he's teaching them people inapellation mountains who are ad eerdesperate meety for jobs skills 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0168.wav Ning with your childhood because you sort of fellin to stand up it seems like but you really wanted to be on 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0171.wav S you saw in broadway yes clams on a half shell nineteen seventy three i believe it was i was ten or eleven i know my mother had died so it was after march seventy thre

MSP-PODCAST_0167_0181_0001.wav At i had never seen a performer like that middler so that was the beginning and n then she had three back up singers colld harlets right 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0181_0002.wav And so in my mind i thought well i'm not really a good singer but i beg you i could be one of her back up singers 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0181_0003.wav And then i went to see more musicals and than i saw ino more shows and and i would stand outside the stage door and watch these sweady actors come out and i would think 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0181_0004.wav O k this is what i definitely want to do how do i end up getting here

MSP-PODCAST_0167_0205.wav You knobso like cobsolf i oit rite it and i don't think 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0206.wav Ad to day's kind of pop culture elexicon there's re 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0208.wav And she doesn't make fun of herself you know she kind of puts down othe people or or makes you know political observations about society' set ups 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0210.wav That she tries to evicerate people the way joan rifers did 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0211_0001.wav Yes but ieven when you were talking about an when i said like how did you possily win home coming weno queen class president class clowner and ll thesethings

MSP-PODCAST_0167_0217.wav Tion to the janitor as i did to the principle as i did to the nurty kid as i did to the jacq right so i i was an equal opportunity

MSP-PODCAST_0167_0219_0002.wav And there's so many different easy passes that give them access so when i walk down the street or when i go to a restaurant people will come over and say hello to me 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0219_0003.wav And feel an intimacy with me ah that makes me sometimes question whether or not i've met them before i normally i go through ake try to see if i actually know this person 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0221_0001.wav Tell me what the connection is so people will say my mother died when i was a kid too i also have a child with a learning disability 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0221_0002.wav I also had a heart attack i lost weight too i'm a gay person 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0222.wav Ime in there is soul i  eyebrows well that's my point as there are so many way

MSP-PODCAST_0167_0226_0003.wav Even ah we'll be golder persay i don't know her intimately but i would say that 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0226_0004.wav People can put themselves out there but that doesn't necessarily a make them accessible to other people and that is a rare gift that you possess as a standup 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0228.wav Ably before i was a stand up too like as a young kid my parents used to tell me that you know i would talk to everyone in the street i would stot you know 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0230.wav Lled i would stop and talk to the ice cream man i would stop the ice command and

MSP-PODCAST_0167_0233_0002.wav And then being able to articulate that in a way that's really funny you also possess ampathy so it's another a stap an ithng that's why you were able to bridge 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0233_0003.wav Am from going from a presentational style of standup to a conversational style 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0236_0001.wav Was really interesting the thing that helped me the most due that was being of e j 
MSP-PODCAST_0167_0236_0002.wav Because when you do stand up you know you present a fully wrapped package and and you know it's presented really well it's like from tifanies tit's in a box it's got a

MSP-PODCAST_0175_0065.wav I've met many of them myself their very nice and intelligent people 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0071.wav On the other side of the spectrum open source p t p file sinchranization programm sink thing has been rebranded as pulse 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0074.wav Indy spelled in d dot i e 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0088.wav Block chain decentralize transactions and autonomius agents decentralize decision making unqu 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0100.wav And the line between technology and humanity becomes so blurred as to become indistinguishable 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0101.wav Will this technological revolution be liberating or enslaving 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0107.wav And which way one goes will depend on a lot of factors including cultural societal governmental and technological 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0119.wav Architectural problems withit a many different new types of networks a were invented 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0128.wav And incripting emili still e a somewhat unsolved problem but i decided to tackle one side of that problem baya incripting it on the end user device 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0130.wav You could a tell espunachto in cripped mail and then when the usur launched mail itwould ask them for their password 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0134.wav Though the closest that we've got in so far as a sort of that that 's even remotely useful as g p g 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0135.wav But you know ythat still is a usibility nightmare and thats sort of the the next sep for me as to a work on making that usible while simultaneously being and to end incriptit 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0138.wav Back in college when i decided to start incripting a peopil's emale on their a computers on one end point 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0140.wav Dieu a incripted emal nd to nd a inincripted communications in general andto nd 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0142.wav And o entend incripted messaging and the biggest problem that is facing that world is authentication 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0146.wav In order for somebody to send you an email they have to get your public key and that's a useability nightmare 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0149.wav Problem is how do i get somebody's public key in order to send them an incripted email how do i know that that 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0154.wav Wore he said ah that the block chain squares zuko's triangle and what it essentially makes it possible is for you don't meet to meet you in person or over the inner net 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0156.wav An end to end incripted message be at gemail or  anything else the blockchian makes that possible 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0157.wav This is how people are already used to i am conditioned to sending email so in order to make end to end incripted email a usible 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0165.wav Facility all kinds of a different types of a distributed in the centralized businesses and services 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0168.wav So that that is how identity works on line to day it's mostly twitter de search somebody's name on a search engine ah and if they have a twitter account that will oftentimes be the number one result 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0171.wav And for that reason they have become almost synonymous with identity to day whereas before it used to be your website 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0172.wav So these days quitter seems to to be almost anonymous with identity and then to a lesser extent your personal webbsihte 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0176.wav You know decide that they don't like somebody shut down their account and they've done this similarly nobody owns their web sight to day 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0177.wav People think that they own their websipe but they actually rent it from an organization called icam and while fairly rare it does happen when many different web sides 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0179.wav Et cetera so people these ays tend to rent their amline identities they don't own them 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0183.wav Nobody can take it away from you the only way that that would be possible was if all of a sudden the developers completely changed the nature of name coin 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0187.wav The block chain is a wonderful tool for getting rid of middlemen so what word does deon es chaine fit in alta into all of this 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0188.wav The problem with name coin is that it's very difficult to get set up and running with name coin 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0190.wav So if you want to be able to take advantage of all these uno fantastic features that it provides you could dounloat it and then you could have it running on your lap top 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0197.wav Except i just use it remotely vieu the server that it's running on so i talked to dianus chain over a man in the middle proof connection 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0198.wav And then all o the information in the name coin blockchain is then becomes accessible to me including all those public keys and those public keys can be used for g p g they can be used 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0210.wav And i use that term to revert systems that provide individual security from to day's threats 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0211.wav From the the sort of a global masterveilance threats a that people face to day in reality and any system that cannot protect users 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0218.wav Ah you know  then that's the case y message for example would be a protical that does not diride meaning fol security because apple holds those keys 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0229.wav And then you use that to create new keys as you're talking to them to incrippet messages and these keys are forgotten they 're not stored anywhere they 'recalled the phemeral keys because of that 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0233.wav Not even the people who are communicating you know after the fact can acis that data and a decriptint 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0235.wav How does deanness chain and and ok turtles meet this meaningful security criteria 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0237.wav The missing puzzlepiece that it fills dynastrian allows people to easily obtain the aaccurate up to date public keys for any entity 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0242.wav Andtel the usur that you know the connection to this website is secure even though it's not a fraudulent key was issued 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0247.wav But unlike to day's system users actually have reason to trust the diaoneschan servant they have legitimate reason to trust 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0248.wav Because either they own and operate that dionescian server themselves or it's one of their close trustworthy friends whose a operating the server 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0254.wav And if that were the case then the people living in that home don't need to ask their innernete service provider they don't need to trust anyonen that they don't trust 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0256.wav And they would be able to securely send emale and various other forms of secure communication to their friends 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0257.wav Without having to rely a on untrustworthy third parties that could potentially man in in the middle of the connection 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0265.wav One is the i p address of the server and since it's ha deones server that kind of already need to know that for example many people a no gugul's very memorable d'anes server i ps 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0268.wav And can change the deones servers aipeter and in the case of a deaneschanserver running on a rowder 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0271.wav And on the second piece of information i that's needed is ah the dianesschain server's publice fingerprint 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0276.wav But the point is is that yes at some point you're goin to have to trust somebody if you don't trust anybody at all you u our basically out of luck 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0278.wav So the point of dones chain is to severely limit by orders of magnitude the number of entities that need to be trusted you know from thousands to one 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0281.wav You know their intiate service provider or that they would trust the a tin esa who can manipulate their inernent service provider 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0283.wav It's an interesting security model an interesting trust model 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0288.wav Against a block chain so with that said 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0300.wav Ah m before i forget i'd like to make a comment on thethat terminology on the little cuward of a trestless that you brought im 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0306.wav To be able to use name coin in a trustless way you have to run a name coinote on the machine that you are using 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0308.wav One of the most promising ones is called ultimate blockshain compression for unspent transaction outputs 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0313.wav So even even if say at some point in the future somebody manages to get a system that uno uses that technology up in running i suspect that doness chain will still be a preferable model 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0327.wav And double spendan young things like that but it's still extremely secure even in the face of a fifty one per centattack 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0330.wav Of like super like alien attackers coming at our block chain and us having to do like cripto congfu to protect our block chain in private keys from attackers 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0331.wav We've established that a fifty one per cent attack at most could mabe censor new entries into the block chain 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0332.wav With very little ability to actually mess with the integrity of that data that's actually already in the block chain 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0333.wav One other threat that's a little bit different than fifty one per centattax would be like quantum computing i assume that 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0338.wav But ah that is curesay at this point if time that i cannot vouch for i would say that if that proves to be true 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0340.wav Oke let's got to know so if anybody out there is concerned about this stuff start investing in quantum chrotography 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0342.wav So there are two projects that are involved in this ah there's deanes jan and then there's o k turtles 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0343.wav Both of which are under the umbrella of a non prophet called the ok turtle's foundation currently most of the development has been focussed on d'aneschan and the audience for that is very different 
MSP-PODCAST_0175_0354.wav The point of dianeschain is to make it very very simple for applications and users to access the information in these block chains 
MSP-PODCAST_0181_0053.wav It would be like eba were it's clear that the sellers aren't eba employs but independent merchants who simply use eba's platform to find buyers for their products 
MSP-PODCAST_0181_0059.wav On march seventeenth twenty fifteen the evolution market place and forum servers went down never to come back on line 
MSP-PODCAST_0181_0149.wav Because he said that there are these robots producing value and it's somewhat unfair that you know there's almost like a monopoly on robots a very small percentage of people 
MSP-PODCAST_0181_0287.wav Generally speaking and you have some interesting ideas about how to implement basic income 
MSP-PODCAST_0181_0328.wav Or other places that are among the highest costs of living in the world 
MSP-PODCAST_0183_0084.wav Well detroit in particular i can definitely see a great need there that's really alesome so how can people get involved if they want to help somebody on hand up 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0008.wav Bit seed is selling products that support the decentralized internet 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0015.wav All patrons who send me a copy of their patrion receapt along with a biquin address from counterwalladario are eligible to participate in my elti bquin give away programme

MSP-PODCAST_0184_0028.wav Motherboard obtains sube samples of the accounts being offered and has confirmed that they are still active 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0029.wav It still on clear where the data came from or just how large the breach was 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0032.wav Other personal information exposed on the uber profile can also be obtained by any one who gains access to these hacked accounts 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0039.wav These are palsy proposals for the short term home rental market popularized by purtipur home sharing market places like arbian b and nine flats 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0043.wav Cities already make policies and regulate markets in order to insure fair access to vital resources 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0055.wav Such a band could lead to arrest against peaceful people using and developing these platforms 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0057.wav And can see how they would think that these proposals will address their concerns 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0065.wav It's a really great article in explains why a lot of these characterizations of these markets tat unregulated are completely inaccurate 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0066.wav Just look for example at what government interference in the housing market in san francisco has done so far 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0074.wav Another proposal to regulate the pureto pure economy has been making its rounds 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0077.wav Prohibit a person from engaging in this state in the business of virtual currency unquoe without either a license or a special exemption from the state 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0083.wav I really preciate terry's bravery in speaking out against this bill and thank him for supporting the petition 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0088.wav The magic word for to day's episode is market that's m a r k e t market 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0097.wav My tiny hint of a claim to fame is that i'm y i write economics and finance at a blow called interfluidity that has a certain amount of nich notoriety 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0102.wav So for the last year so of become more and more involved in the cripto currencies lash distributed concensis community 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0108.wav Because we can all be a lot of peers but there can be not much interesting too happening between us we can be atams or we can just be chaotic an ways at or uninteresting 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0120.wav But it's one application in putting my sort of economist hat on it's really a very flowd application in how it's arranged and the things it acclaims that if it wants to be able to do 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0121.wav So i got a little bit excited about piccoyn but not really all that excited i was more excited by the architecture 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0125.wav It's that really excited me so etheory um i'm still 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0131.wav Hich is an architecture i think we should try to get away from 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0132.wav So you know so it's it's its really an exciting moment with with the theoryan because 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0133.wav If the platform you know works is advertisin works well which is a big iff 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0136.wav Ithey' they're in a way ther thertheyre too many a mian 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0141.wav The knowledge and interests of much broader publics into effectiv political action 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0142.wav Um that smart political action both from the perspective of being strategically effective and being good policy 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0143.wav Um so that's what i would love to see come from platforms like a theory 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0150.wav That may or may not have incentives or may or may not have its heart um in in putting the interests of that community affront 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0155.wav I'd really like to see the kind of web to point o and this is clechet in the ectherium communit 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0158.wav Just analyes their data and aggregate and all of that and giving the value of that back to the community in giving control of those platforms back to the community that excally creates the value 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0160.wav Ya and so this podcass p t p connects us is syndicated on the less talk bit coinnet work 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0164.wav Obviously because we're still in a web tupeno kind of paradime the webside itself is scentially hosted and managed 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0166.wav So ii'm not so familiar we've offline had a couple of conversations about it but i i don't know all that much but generally i think 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0169.wav Community scripper token specific to some particular group of people or application 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0171.wav And again it's it's ware i'm really hopeful that a platform like a theory will really be helpful because 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0174.wav But again the question of ownership of who really owns the thing is is is pretty important 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0176.wav Ause i know that's just it's a marketing thing managed by the issuer managed by an air line and they'll mess with it 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0178.wav Um and you know i' i prefer to have the token and to not have it i'd like to get a free flight sometime 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0179.wav A but it's not really a profound chain 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0183.wav Come and so that's you know right away it's a little bit more posocial but the the 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0188.wav Formarketing for all kinds of things to happen 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0189.wav And all of a sudden the character of what started out as very smartly arranged 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0191.wav All of the subtle misbehavior that lots of us associate with the web to point o platforms 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0192.wav With something like el ti b coin the problem rate now is it is a great idea but what if it succeeded really well and actually being the el ti b coin issuer became really valuable what would happen 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0194.wav Um but the people were great with lots of you know the the gugalgais i think were afsen when they started i don't think it's highly of them any more 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0195.wav Um it's pudeff not to say that there's anything wrong with them as people it's tat you know you 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0202.wav Um and we we we should be really excited to have 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0203.wav Institutions that can stand to succeed that don't always have to be marginal and experimental 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0208.wav Ya so i've talked about elte be coin before on the show 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0210.wav The basic idea behind el t b coin 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0213.wav Which is given away to content creators on the platform as well as people who participate in the online communities 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0217.wav And they specify all the ways that you can earn el t b coin 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0221.wav And i believe it's going to be maybe two or three years from now that that supply taper's off 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0226.wav And it will actually take el t b coin too run one of these swap bots if you want to run it yourself 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0233.wav Well the first thing to notice is it sounds like it eventually wants to become the most basic kind of tokin right which is an iowe you one tookin 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0235.wav That deserves to be pat in some way and they give you token 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0246.wav I don't really need to have you know to have my name on the network bat somebody else might want that 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0248.wav Um and so the exchange value of the token will then depend in a pretty direct way onon how much people value the services at the network can provide that use value 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0250.wav That would be like you know tryinga and if if the main service a atwer provides the people for the took an is something like you know sponsorship advertising 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0257.wav Can cuing to put a floor on the used body of the token by kind of imagining that all the tokens are going to be used for for sponsorships 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0258.wav They're some tricky things about thinking about how the flow works what happens when the tokens are paid or they redeemed and disappear or they pay to other people they're details in their 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0260.wav That would be more of a floor than a feeling because 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0263.wav That tends to in an unstable way but at least for a while you know 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0266.wav Om the value of it coin ins higher then it would otherwise be if all bit coin that had ever been mind was actively circulated 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0267.wav Ii think it's it's kind of a mistake to rely for most hokens to rely upon that kind of value as a sorce of value it 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0268.wav The only reason to really bring it up is to say that the fundamental values a kind of floor 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0273.wav Then the network should actually sell more tokens into the demand 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0274.wav And use the proceeds of that to do things that will enhance the value of the network over time 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0278.wav They issue stock to acquire other firms that offer acets to them that will increase the long term value of the firm 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0282.wav That then support the token from the bottom that increase its fundamental value 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0283.wav So that would be the kind of thing i would think that a a nutwork like elte b might try to think about and consider building into its model 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0284.wav So that like a traditional business ought to do 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0285.wav The odd thing is is it in the traditional finance this notion of using the issuince of token's issuince of stock in particular 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0291.wav In the cripto asa community we really have an opportunity to kind of 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0292.wav We do an understandable but lamentable historical path 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0293.wav Where this idea of ougenerate value people get excited bout your tokens and then you use that enthusiasm 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0296.wav Yyou're going to turn your dream into something real and solid a thing that 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0301.wav As you said selling into the demand and then using that you newly invested capital to actually invest in things that will improve the long term 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0303.wav Yea so i i wouldn't want to see itself ufilling because most of the time it won't be fulfilled right most 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0304.wav Their most businesses fall and most great ideas 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0305.wav Whether there whether they just steem great and theyare not really so great or whether there ausum but very difficult to execute 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0308.wav There's never going to be any guarantee in most speculative enterprises are probably always going to fail 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0311.wav So hopefully the tokens that have those you know real bouts a speculative enthusiasm 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0312.wav Our token for which at least the dream itself is a good one a pretty good prospect 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0319.wav People will do their very best with that money and it does work out 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0320.wav That's a great distinction i appreciate you making that clarification 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0321.wav Another thing that we discussed briefly was this idea of using demerage as a way to may be head off inflation 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0325.wav Oh ye i see a roll for demorase particularly in limited supply currencies 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0328.wav Rit so uyou say iminous ar to limited supply currency 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0332.wav Um and then all of a sudden over time whatever the application or collaboration or business or whatever it is at this token 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0333.wav Is going to be undergirted by actually succeed so sometime in the future 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0335.wav But early on lots of release ar of cheap speculators who didn't do much contributing to the actual value of the enterprise 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0339.wav Yes so it certainly does happen it happens in any market and in any financial market any speculative market and 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0341.wav But it's also not really so fine if the things people get rich from are too disjoint 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0343.wav So in apples case for example apple never issued a fixed token 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0345.wav That early token holders would be entirely deluted out 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0349.wav It doesn't want to so much recently because it has so much cash 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0351.wav Because from a regulatory and also cultural prospective right now issuing new shares for cassh and second secondary offerings is has not done 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0353.wav So that yet tayre not fixed supply and the importat things and they're not sort of the best thing in the world the real 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0354.wav Early investors in in apple did supply a service it was really important wich as that they were willing to bear a lot of risk for something that at the time was totalli you know nothing 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0355.wav And certainly early token holders sometimes do that as well 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0356.wav And so there's a roll for equity like tokens that aren't issued very much 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0358.wav But most of the token that i think were talking about were not really asking people to take large bets 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0360.wav And mostly what we want to do with the tokens as i understand with alti be tokian right as we wanto encourage people to actually perform to do things that add value to the network 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0363.wav But another modelissay while we're issuing tokens because we want you to actually provide value directly to our enterprise 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0364.wav Um and so we're going to pay you in tokens for the enterprisin in if that's your model then these lottery ticket this lottery ticket like behaviour is deeply counter productive 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0365.wav Because as a new entrant wrigt no matter what i do 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0366.wav I can contribute a thousand hours of work to the network 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0367.wav But somebody who contributed two hours of work to the network in is fifth day 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0368.wav Is going to be rewarded lot more than i than i am 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0370.wav It just doesn't well aligne the insentives of people to contribute with the rewards from contribution 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0371.wav To dis kind of have a fixed value token and let people's reward be a matter of happens dente about at what price they purchased that token 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0372.wav Right so with something like demoras you can say basically look here's a deal 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0373.wav We want a basically pay people in tokens 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0375.wav We want a certain contribution zeablogu post you know we want a 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0376.wav Reward you for a blog post with something that pretty much match is 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0377.wav The you know that sponsorship value or however we measure the value of the blood post 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0378.wav En we can put a a dollar figure on him you know we want to pay you something that's you know worth you know may be a hundred dollars for that blogpost 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0380.wav But that amount of tokens has a value that you can understand well 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0382.wav Well one way that you can suport that value as you can say look and holders of older tokens are you going to have to give up some of that value 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0383.wav Right work an actually cake some of those older tokens away or demoras workin a over time fractionly decay older tokens 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0384.wav To make room for new tokens to be more valuable 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0385.wav Um and a net effect of at its wore basically thing we value current contributions a little bit more than old contribution 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0386.wav So as you get a token it starts out with h value and you can you can sell it now 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0387.wav Um but over time dat volue is gointo dissipate 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0388.wav So you might seeb why would anybody ever hold a token that's goin to evaporate for ever well that's what you really have to think about does the token have some kind of value from holding 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0389.wav So if the token pays a divid end or something like that 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0391.wav Well then people hold the tokens not because they expect them to appreciate they know actually their tokens going to decay over time 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0392.wav But they're going to get a dividand stream that starts out high in to cays over time 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0393.wav And it's that divid enstrin that's going to define the value of their token 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0394.wav And so when you decide how much to pay the for the blog post you're going to put a value in that dividense dream and give them the dividense dream that maps to a hundred dollars 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0395.wav And nobody gets screwed because everybody got paid exactly the value that they expected 
MSP-PODCAST_0184_0396.wav And it's just at that value gets paid with a stream of payments that starts out high and goes down over time
