MSP-PODCAST_1649_0016_0009.wav But i don't know what it will be and that's why i study education because it allows us to have a critical mind and speak to power

MSP-PODCAST_1654_0048.wav So yes so that's we gein to at we've got to the end of 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0008.wav Rigt and your p h d is in social policy which is what yo care handling at tragic autumn you'll enna be looking at the tragedy of what 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0002.wav So they the conceit that we desided was the to be tragic back to school and in this case 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0004.wav Some of my lovely colleagues a i ar couldn't be performing for the first time and talking about how theyse to see the tragedy of the welver 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0005.wav State spend depending on their different disciplines and talking to them about what they'ae going to do 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0007.wav Their giving their opinions and thoughts in a way that they wouldn't be doing 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0008.wav I think abnormally and i think it'll be really o in we really nice for the audience and i think it'll be a really uniquec pirit 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0009.wav Cause none of them have ever performed like that before ye 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0011.wav Ctually much credit to stievkraskaus that's one of the things that sort of i was playing with was the idea that scientists get to do this a lot but people in social sciences don't end up doing in a 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0013.wav Ut a shame coseen ar we deal with people or studying eople and people are 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0014.wav Fascinating and weird and funny and tragic and so its i think good to talk about that kind of thing as well outside of 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0016_0002.wav I did now you chace to i jus i o dettit it ina i chose to do it and it was fascinating to go back through for a couple of reasons one 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0016_0004.wav This was originally exposed to be one was that it was like impossible to choose it's choosing between your children as choosing between many talented performers many of whom are my friends 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0016_0005.wav Many really beautiful really personal performances some the thing that i found though was that aa lot of the comedy onces didn't translate as well 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0016_0006.wav So it may seem a bit spoken word heavy thot o wye ther three and that's why there's in a big old spretchy but i started listening from the beginning and that was quite interesting abas 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0017.wav Icly gone back and tine traveller aathat may be crangry said the behistening from the beginnin cause i remember how bad the ost original pot casare compared to wear wer at no 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0022_0002.wav I kind i thought this was a good approach to do just because they've been so variable and i didn't want to not give credit to some of the earlier work 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0002.wav And i thought that was bit interesting like listening back to that first season 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0004.wav I think there's a a great beauty in in in it's this mother 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0005.wav Well i won't go into too much of it because you'll be listening  yo spoilers but 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0006.wav Iam i think it's really wonderful and an i connect a little bit to the main character in what you say even though i it's it sort of a fantasy 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0007.wav I think but on the other hand you can see how it can very easily not be a fantasy and it is quite tragic so that was my best of from london 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0027.wav And as mentioned expect poor san quality at this point in our journey but it will get better yer here we go

MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0003.wav Now just this point oul the little bi 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0004.wav I'm going to do now is about explaining what is like to be fat and if you are fat 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0006.wav Well i already no all this why are you explaining this to me 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0007.wav It's almost as if i'm some kind of second rate human being bat's you're fat you're used to that 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0008.wav Im i i'm fat this is how fat i am im wone thing about being fat 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0010.wav You not meant to mention it 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0011.wav And the other thing about being fat 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0013.wav And i know how fat i am i'm not going to look at a photograph of myself 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0014.wav One day ango oh my god i've got an ass in the same way 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0015.wav E would' look at the photograph of your house and go on my gop is en upstairs 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0016.wav I i live here 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0017.wav I know what it's like fat people know that they're fat 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0019.wav I know you know 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0002.wav And that as i understand it is how being fat works 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0004.wav That's the system that no one has agreed upon 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0005.wav If you're fat there's couple of things you can do an 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0008.wav That's acthlly the most popular the most popular one and 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0009.wav But if you don't if you decide that what you want is to try and change your body that's that's the kind of difficult thing i mean there is a kind of idea that there's a kind of physics to this the 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0011.wav That's the body you have but you know it's not as simple as that and 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0013.wav They were actually only trying to lose like one very tiny pound of weight anyweiy 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0014.wav And that is now pretty much common knowledge every one knows you can't lose weight from dieting 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0015.wav Babies are now born with this in their dea nay that they know that you 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0016.wav Can't lose weight from dieting em aliens on planets without gravity no that you can't lose weight by dieting 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0019.wav It may be possible to lose weight from something called a life style change but no one knows what that is 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0020.wav And the more i think about it the more i think what they mean when they say life style change is just being dead 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0021.wav Which i suppose would work 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0022.wav I don't do that 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0023.wav I've chosen the best option which is being o k about my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0024.wav I am o q about my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0026.wav So obviously imo qu about my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0027.wav 'm making a show cld how to be fat with a person who wasn't tho quet about their fat body do th 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0029.wav I am o q about my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0030.wav Woult a person who wasn't oquet about their fat body make a show about having a fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0031.wav Obviously not i am auqut 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0032.wav About my fat body i'm so o q i've made a show about it 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0033.wav In my show i'm going have a guess my weight competition 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0034.wav I'm ga doing this because i think it will be upsetting 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0035.wav Wait is an upsetting think people get up sait about itif i'm not allowed to tell you that i'm fat 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0036.wav Am even let allowed to tell you my weight and you are certainly not allowed to tell me what you think my weight is and that is why i'm going to have a guess my weight competition 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0037.wav So i told the director of my sh 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0039.wav Competition the director of my show is a very fat man 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0041.wav Why do you want to do that d i said because i don't think people know what fat people way 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0045.wav Put this par inn where i say that the ex director of my show 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0046.wav Does not wait twenty two stone 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0047.wav Apparently he weighs fifteen and a halfstone 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0048.wav I don't know if that's true but he's asked me to say it 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0050.wav I i'm going t have a guess why weight competition is going to be like a guess the weight of the cake competition that you have in a fake except obviously you don't win a cake 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0051.wav You just win me which is slightly less good than winning a cake if you don't think that's less good 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0052.wav I really worry about your needs a gain ownership of a fat middle aged woman but it's not our good thing to win 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0055.wav But i'm making a show about my fat body and i'm holding a guest my weigh 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0056.wav Competition and the reason i'm doing this is because i am o k with my fat body and that is how o k i am about it i am very very o k 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0057.wav Et cetit is quite hard 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0058.wav To be o k with your fat body and a thing about being o k with your fat body is in many ways 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0059.wav Itsas prone to failure and disappointment as changing your fat body which in case you don't remember from two minutes ago is very prone to failure and disappointment indeed 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0060.wav So the thing about that option though being o quy with my fat bodies if i fail at it 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0061.wav T least you can't tell by looking at me 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0062.wav You can't tell that i'm not o qu with my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0063.wav You'd never you'd never know you'd never know that i'm not a q with my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0064.wav A makg a show ab fat body you'd a sume  was o kay with i 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0065.wav I think and bet things i really do want to be ok with my fat body and the reason why 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0066.wav I want to be oqut with my fat body is because 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0067.wav I've kind of always assumed that if i was o qet with my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0069.wav So i thoght if i make a show about my fat body that will make me o qy about my fat body and then by the end of the show 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0070.wav I'll be sinn 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0072.wav You can come and see the show and see how well that's actually worked 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0073.wav Money is a live style change being in a show 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0001.wav Right so i mean as i as i said earlier on the every act is different so expect the unexpected 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0002.wav M and the next act is certainly unexpected 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0004.wav He was hammering grape into the face of just in beb 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0005.wav Whilst reciting greece greek tragedy so i have no idea what can happen now 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0006.wav Ay hav we doing his new show the golden age of steam

MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0002.wav Ah a case ithat the next act would have been na sophia walker but she's had to pull out to day 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0004.wav She's an amazing spoken word artist and she i you should totally check her out ah but she had to pull out at the last minute 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0006.wav 'm i moving my set that was in the tragic sex part of the night 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0007.wav To hear ah because it also fits with tragic beginnings 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0008.wav Ah so you get some extra sex ah ansom anso and and the nexta the next act is me so put your hands together for me 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0010.wav Notes in that first of all the content that your hearing is very new ah and so be be be patient with it 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0013.wav You want but that's what's happening i write so i'm doing my show ian a solow show in edinburgh this year and it's called what 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0016.wav My questions about what what men think about patriarchy and what men think about masculinity 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0017.wav Um and so i'm going to do the first little bit of that tt i've ever done in public 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0018.wav It won't be the start of that show but that'swhat im going do today again 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0019.wav So in that survey i i asked people how patriarchy has hurt them 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0020.wav Ah that's one of the things i asked him one of the ways that patriarchy has hurt me is in the way its influenced my understanding and my experience of sex 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0022.wav I invented something amazing 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0023.wav I discovered something that nobody else in the world had ever known 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0024.wav I discovered it late at night lying in bed i found that my body could do this amazing amazing thing 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0025.wav And i couldn't wait till the next day to tell everybody else about it 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0026.wav I gathered around a group of young men around the same age as me 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0028.wav I discovered this amazing thing i call it simulated sex 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0029.wav And i described to them what i been doing which was rubbing myself until i cheaved ogasm and they said 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0031.wav Everyone knows about that and i realized they hadn't invented similated sex 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0033.wav One of the ways that you could describe my upbringing is feminist until i was eight my father looked after me and my mum went out to work 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0034.wav My older half sisters who are old enough to have played aunt like rolls in my childhood as well as my mammar my dad were influenced by the feminise movements of the sixties and the seventies 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0035.wav The women in my family were strong feminised roll models debunking many of the social myths that get imparted to young children foru culture 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0036.wav In fact in my family it's the women who mae who 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0037.wav Both make the decisions and wield the financial clouts 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0039.wav However ah if we we hve if we have to look at things through this 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0040.wav Dominata model at the people in charge in my family 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0041.wav Other women my mum's marriage to my ste 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0042.wav That was a complicated blip in that but it was just a blip 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0043.wav That blip happened when i turned at and things got complicated 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0044.wav I witnessed and experienced a patriarchal model in my home life and the world stopped being a safe space for me 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0045.wav But even then i had a strong feministe perspective imparted to me by my father during those years he was a member of the evefeminist children's book club and many of the books 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0046.wav I was reading came from there even as i was experiencing the opposite of a positive mal roll modle in my main home when i went to my dance at weekens 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0047.wav I was shown a model of masculinity that embraced not only feminism but love ampathy and compassion 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0048.wav I was dressed in hand me downs from my niece which meant that i was regularly sent to primary school wearing pink jeens 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0049.wav I didn't really conceive of the idea that but boys and girls were significantly different 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0051.wav From then until i was about fifteen all my friends would be boys 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0052.wav I occasionally had girl friends but i didn't have girl 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0054.wav We basically self seggregated ourselves along gender lines 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0056.wav I was around nine years old when charmane case dropped my rubber on the floor 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0057.wav And when i reached  down to pick it up she flashed me her volver 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0058.wav When i was ten or so i told rebecca swift who i was going out with tha 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0059.wav It wasn't right for us to continue to go out because i'd seen charmanesvolver but i hadn't seen hers 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0060.wav This resulted in us showing each other our genitils behind the back of her garden shed 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0061.wav Although i wasn't aware of it at the time 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0062.wav This was as your laughter suggests a very maniplative move and looking back at it makes me shudder 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0064.wav And even in terms of the practicalities 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0065.wav There were clearly some gaps in my understanding as my invention of masturbation should demonstrate 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0068.wav Instead of learning consent and desire why instead managed to learn was guilt 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0071.wav I was inventing mastubation next door to the room where my mamman my step 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0072.wav Dad were ripping each other apart sex became something linked with sadness to me 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0073.wav Awaiy ta momentarily block out the screaming rouse 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0074.wav I think the shaming we had all taught to perpetuate makes all genders into weapons against each other 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0075.wav We slot into a horrible jikaw puzzle that encourages us all to ignore and devalue consent our own and i and each other's 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0077.wav They are shamed in a very different way to men men are seen as disgusting animals 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0078.wav But that is presented as our natural states women who desire a scene as devien 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0079.wav The best stuff that i learn about sex came from my mother although since she doesn't have boundaries 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0081.wav For example she often told me that giving birth to her second son was the most sexual experience of her life 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0082.wav This made me feel pretty strange since i am her second child abut it also taught me something about some women's experiences 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0084.wav Her coming which is a useful thing to know and consider but possibly a questionable emphasis to be to be giving to an adolescent boy i think 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0085.wav Am this is the thing even with progressive and supportive parents 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0087.wav I don't think it's fair to say that when i was a tean agor 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0089.wav I knew that talking to all humans was pretty much the same thing but i didn't know how to talk to girls about desire 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0090.wav I didn't know how to negotiate romance to be honest i'm not sure i do now 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0091.wav If i'd had bare sex education 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0092.wav I'd have known that the idea of virginity is a weird one anyway 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0093.wav Sex isn't just when appenus goes into a virgina there are many ways to have sex 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0094.wav So i'd had sects before i officially lost my viginity 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0095.wav I was having sec at fifteen when me and my previous girl friend were messing around in my bed on enough for six months 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0097.wav I did a lot of things to her at which we both enjoyed but she didn't get me off 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0098.wav I was always confused about why and a few years later when drunker a night club 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0099.wav I asked her and she said that she didn't know either 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0101.wav Again this is i think down to the policing of hetrosexuality 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0102.wav Women i suppose to have sex but not want it and men i suppose to want sex all the time but only in a manly way 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0103.wav If you don't fit that manly modle then you have to push your sexuality down 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0104.wav The best piece of sex education my mum gave me was when i was five years old and myself and another boy of the same age were playing doctors and nurses with his sister and examining each other 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0105.wav Everything was cool and then suddenly it wasn't we'd overstepped a boundary and she was crying 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0106.wav I went to find my mum and tell her what was happening and she came and talke to us and explained the importance of consent and communication 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0107.wav She didn't shame any of us and because of that her lesson definitely had some in impact 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0109.wav I rape my girl friend because i did not know what rape was 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0110.wav Now i've cut it for time for this performance which is already a twelve minutes 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0111.wav I'm sorry to myself but i was sexually assaulted by a woman ah when i was younger and she didn't understand that i wasn't consenting 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0112.wav I don't have enough fingers to count the amount of people i know who are survivors 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0113.wav And that's just the people who have told me 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0114.wav Men don't talk to other men about rape and we certainly don't talk about consent 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0115.wav Men i know will have raped people men 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0116.wav You know will av raped people rapists aren't monsters 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0117.wav They are humans and generally speaking they are men 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0118.wav Why do more men rape 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0119.wav I think it's because of the power dynamics 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0120.wav We currently have and because we have a culture that is supporteve of rape 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0121.wav Men are statistically more likely to be raped by a man than a woman and when they are raped by women 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0122.wav They are less likely to see it as rape and so less likely to report it 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0123.wav Rape like other forms of violence is a power issue not a gender issue 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0124.wav There are survivors of all genders and there are abusers of all gendes 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0126.wav Is there when it isn't talking about consent more and finding ways to articulate our desires more will help us get rid of these mistakes 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0127.wav An a culture of blurred lines encourages and forgives abuse men need to talk to each other and call each other out when we perpetuate rape culture 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0128.wav We needs to make it clear to our peers that it is not socially acceptable to rape that there are more kinds of rape than evil 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0129.wav Monster rape that the medior tells us to be scared of and that we can be raped by men that we can be raped by women and that nice guies do rape 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0131.wav Looking back at my own behavior i have certainly violated boundaries 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0132.wav I have attempted harrison ford style kisses 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0134.wav I have manipulated and lied to persuade people to sleep with me 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0135.wav I am working to change my relationship to consent and improve my ability to express my own desire honestly 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0136.wav Trying to learn how to say what i want and how to listen to what other people want 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0010_0137.wav And judging from the responses that i got doing the man survey i am not alone 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0012_0001.wav But being here for that a i've spared you the a the actual account of my 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0012_0005.wav I when it get to one thousand and i got fifty more men than i need to get things drops off a lot

MSP-PODCAST_1655_0008.wav Rigt and your p h d is in social policy which is what yo care handling at tragic autumn you'll enna be looking at the tragedy of what 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0002.wav So they the conceit that we desided was the to be tragic back to school and in this case 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0004.wav Some of my lovely colleagues a i ar couldn't be performing for the first time and talking about how theyse to see the tragedy of the welver 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0005.wav State spend depending on their different disciplines and talking to them about what they'ae going to do 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0007.wav Their giving their opinions and thoughts in a way that they wouldn't be doing 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0008.wav I think abnormally and i think it'll be really o in we really nice for the audience and i think it'll be a really uniquec pirit 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0009_0009.wav Cause none of them have ever performed like that before ye 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0011.wav Ctually much credit to stievkraskaus that's one of the things that sort of i was playing with was the idea that scientists get to do this a lot but people in social sciences don't end up doing in a 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0013.wav Ut a shame coseen ar we deal with people or studying eople and people are 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0014.wav Fascinating and weird and funny and tragic and so its i think good to talk about that kind of thing as well outside of 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0016_0002.wav I did now you chace to i jus i o dettit it ina i chose to do it and it was fascinating to go back through for a couple of reasons one 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0016_0004.wav This was originally exposed to be one was that it was like impossible to choose it's choosing between your children as choosing between many talented performers many of whom are my friends 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0016_0005.wav Many really beautiful really personal performances some the thing that i found though was that aa lot of the comedy onces didn't translate as well 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0016_0006.wav So it may seem a bit spoken word heavy thot o wye ther three and that's why there's in a big old spretchy but i started listening from the beginning and that was quite interesting abas 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0017.wav Icly gone back and tine traveller aathat may be crangry said the behistening from the beginnin cause i remember how bad the ost original pot casare compared to wear wer at no 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0022_0002.wav I kind i thought this was a good approach to do just because they've been so variable and i didn't want to not give credit to some of the earlier work 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0002.wav And i thought that was bit interesting like listening back to that first season 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0004.wav I think there's a a great beauty in in in it's this mother 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0005.wav Well i won't go into too much of it because you'll be listening  yo spoilers but 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0006.wav Iam i think it's really wonderful and an i connect a little bit to the main character in what you say even though i it's it sort of a fantasy 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0025_0007.wav I think but on the other hand you can see how it can very easily not be a fantasy and it is quite tragic so that was my best of from london 
MSP-PODCAST_1655_0027.wav And as mentioned expect poor san quality at this point in our journey but it will get better yer here we go

MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0016.wav I i live here 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0017.wav I know what it's like fat people know that they're fat 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0022_0019.wav I know you know 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0002.wav And that as i understand it is how being fat works 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0004.wav That's the system that no one has agreed upon 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0005.wav If you're fat there's couple of things you can do an 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0008.wav That's acthlly the most popular the most popular one and 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0009.wav But if you don't if you decide that what you want is to try and change your body that's that's the kind of difficult thing i mean there is a kind of idea that there's a kind of physics to this the 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0011.wav That's the body you have but you know it's not as simple as that and 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0013.wav They were actually only trying to lose like one very tiny pound of weight anyweiy 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0014.wav And that is now pretty much common knowledge every one knows you can't lose weight from dieting 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0015.wav Babies are now born with this in their dea nay that they know that you 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0016.wav Can't lose weight from dieting em aliens on planets without gravity no that you can't lose weight by dieting 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0019.wav It may be possible to lose weight from something called a life style change but no one knows what that is 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0020.wav And the more i think about it the more i think what they mean when they say life style change is just being dead 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0021.wav Which i suppose would work 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0022.wav I don't do that 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0023.wav I've chosen the best option which is being o k about my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0024.wav I am o q about my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0026.wav So obviously imo qu about my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0027.wav 'm making a show cld how to be fat with a person who wasn't tho quet about their fat body do th 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0029.wav I am o q about my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0030.wav Woult a person who wasn't oquet about their fat body make a show about having a fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0031.wav Obviously not i am auqut 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0032.wav About my fat body i'm so o q i've made a show about it 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0033.wav In my show i'm going have a guess my weight competition 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0034.wav I'm ga doing this because i think it will be upsetting 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0035.wav Wait is an upsetting think people get up sait about itif i'm not allowed to tell you that i'm fat 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0036.wav Am even let allowed to tell you my weight and you are certainly not allowed to tell me what you think my weight is and that is why i'm going to have a guess my weight competition 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0037.wav So i told the director of my sh 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0039.wav Competition the director of my show is a very fat man 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0041.wav Why do you want to do that d i said because i don't think people know what fat people way 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0045.wav Put this par inn where i say that the ex director of my show 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0046.wav Does not wait twenty two stone 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0047.wav Apparently he weighs fifteen and a halfstone 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0048.wav I don't know if that's true but he's asked me to say it 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0050.wav I i'm going t have a guess why weight competition is going to be like a guess the weight of the cake competition that you have in a fake except obviously you don't win a cake 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0051.wav You just win me which is slightly less good than winning a cake if you don't think that's less good 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0052.wav I really worry about your needs a gain ownership of a fat middle aged woman but it's not our good thing to win 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0055.wav But i'm making a show about my fat body and i'm holding a guest my weigh 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0056.wav Competition and the reason i'm doing this is because i am o k with my fat body and that is how o k i am about it i am very very o k 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0057.wav Et cetit is quite hard 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0058.wav To be o k with your fat body and a thing about being o k with your fat body is in many ways 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0059.wav Itsas prone to failure and disappointment as changing your fat body which in case you don't remember from two minutes ago is very prone to failure and disappointment indeed 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0060.wav So the thing about that option though being o quy with my fat bodies if i fail at it 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0061.wav T least you can't tell by looking at me 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0062.wav You can't tell that i'm not o qu with my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0063.wav You'd never you'd never know you'd never know that i'm not a q with my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0064.wav A makg a show ab fat body you'd a sume  was o kay with i 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0065.wav I think and bet things i really do want to be ok with my fat body and the reason why 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0066.wav I want to be oqut with my fat body is because 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0067.wav I've kind of always assumed that if i was o qet with my fat body 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0069.wav So i thoght if i make a show about my fat body that will make me o qy about my fat body and then by the end of the show 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0070.wav I'll be sinn 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0072.wav You can come and see the show and see how well that's actually worked 
MSP-PODCAST_1676_0024_0073.wav Money is a live style change being in a show 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0001.wav Right so i mean as i as i said earlier on the every act is different so expect the unexpected 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0002.wav M and the next act is certainly unexpected 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0004.wav He was hammering grape into the face of just in beb 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0005.wav Whilst reciting greece greek tragedy so i have no idea what can happen now 
MSP-PODCAST_1677_0008_0006.wav Ay hav we doing his new show the golden age of steam
