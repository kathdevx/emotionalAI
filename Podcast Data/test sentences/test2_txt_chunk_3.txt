MSP-PODCAST_1869_0007.wav Yet we have some clients who are doing really well and we've got some communications from 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0010.wav It's my expectations sr i right the goals are really high right 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0012.wav Lit aa a  and s 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0014.wav Sabatagis is that we make an ideal for ourselves 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0017.wav It's not realistic especially when we don't create patterns to set ourselves up for success and we also add all these expectations onto ourselves about 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0018.wav Doing these extra things for ourselves but w 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0029.wav That i set these really high goals and it' sceried now if like it s 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0030.wav Ears me and so then we become frozen 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0031.wav And then when we don't do something that will help us get to that goal where like owere an failure or we're not good enough 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0034.wav Re all that nasty stuff comes up and so 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0035.wav If we reassess like your saying those gulls and try to chunk em down a little betr 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0038.wav His is how it starts with this one first step

MSP-PODCAST_1869_0072.wav Ourselves but we might not engage support from our pures and our family or professionals and i think when we have 
MSP-PODCAST_1869_0073.wav Our community on board with what we're trying to do it makes the success
