MSP-PODCAST_1814_0877.wav Personal a statement i don't believe it's fair to refer to them as unintended consequences 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0880.wav Anybody teacher school government can be really let off the hook 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0885.wav Spectrate style investigations of teachers have been shown around the world to have a negative deprofes 
MSP-PODCAST_1814_0887.wav That we really no longer can consider those as unintended consequences and again to get back to the reason why i brought up the stupidity par

MSP-PODCAST_1819_0034.wav Ar is a rather simplistic notion 
MSP-PODCAST_1819_0035.wav When we're talking about government money anmy you can have a household deficit where you know if you spend too much money and you're not good enough money coming in that's a deaf asit for sure

MSP-PODCAST_1819_0041.wav The government is using this defacit is grating is money at spending

MSP-PODCAST_1821_0017.wav Ome people feel very helpless about it and i have to admit that i frequently feel very helpless about th 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0019.wav Got a lot of experience having worked with inner city youth here in pittsburgh and i've attended too many funerals of young people who have fall into the hands of violence i have 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0020.wav Friends who are african americans i have friends who are police a 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0022.wav And family who are gay straight and everything in between 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0023.wav And i believe that it is this diversity that makes our world a richer place 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0025.wav And how do we as christians come up with a loving and faithful response without playing into the fear and the division that happens in times such as this 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0026.wav If you listened to my sermon from sunday morning 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0032.wav Remember that we have a variety of different opinions and experiences on everything that goes down around us and we can still be brothers and sister 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0036.wav Nswers but there are some essential elements that i think our key to seeking a truly loving and christian response when it feels like the world is crumbling around us to day 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0039.wav I want to talk about discussion and dialogue and y want to talk about learning and about getting out of your 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0042.wav S own so we'r goig to talk about those four thing 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0045.wav In series this summer is going to be on christian disciplines and will be covering the disciplines in great detail and the podcast will probably be following along with that re

MSP-PODCAST_1821_0047.wav Chpad or us i think that looking at our spiritual journ 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0049.wav Tis in the world the first thing i wanted to talk about is 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0050.wav Fellowship now those of you who have been listening to my sermons for some time or who know me personally know how very deeply important fellowship and community are 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0052.wav Even the non christian hipsterkind of way we use community but i mean good old 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0053.wav D ashion christian community the sort of folks that when the stuff 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0054.wav Hits the fan you can go straight to them and just 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0058.wav And especially in times of crisis times of violence times of difficulty 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0062.wav That might look like attending vigils you know i've had a few people 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0063.wav Ll say to me ya well o kas so you and your kid went to this candlelike vigil after the pulse night club shooting 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0066.wav Friends and family and loved ones and those who don't know us

MSP-PODCAST_1821_0082.wav Ow you know figure out what is paris like watch some travel shows get to know the people and the country in any way that you can that is a form of prayer 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0086.wav It's more than just saying i am praying for fill in the blank it's more 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0087.wav Then just changing your face book profile picture while

MSP-PODCAST_1821_0126.wav An also lead to really heated discussions on line this 
MSP-PODCAST_1821_0127.wav Y to all sorts of yelling and screaming and inappropriate interaction with one another and i don't know what it is about the innernet that depersonalizes people in a way that it makes it eas

MSP-PODCAST_1821_0131.wav That should be holding our pansop so we don't get caught looking like a fool with no pants on i think that it's really important for us too ex

MSP-PODCAST_1821_0153.wav Ana think that that's the the core of when we're having these discussions because we can't possibly have a healthy or productive discussion about
