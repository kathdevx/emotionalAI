MSP-PODCAST_0500_0060.wav Because the germans really did get the short end of the stick it caused hyper inflation as they tried to pay off the dwar debt it was it was it was a massive disaster

MSP-PODCAST_0500_0074.wav One of the other reasons it was critical that we go to war and why it was able why we were able to achieve victori as because there was 
MSP-PODCAST_0500_0079.wav One of the other things that we had during that time as we had most of the people who fought in the wars were not idealistic 
MSP-PODCAST_0500_0088.wav And so when you combined the fact that you didn't have bideological warriors in a man 
MSP-PODCAST_0500_0089.wav Scale and you had a nation state that could be defeated you had something that you could achieve war could be what victory could be defined not so much to day

MSP-PODCAST_0500_0101.wav And we would commit as much violence on each other until we achieved that end i am not suggesting that that was the best way 
MSP-PODCAST_0500_0103.wav It was a war that could be won 
MSP-PODCAST_0500_0105.wav It's not an enemy that can be defeated at least not through bombs and bullets 
MSP-PODCAST_0500_0107.wav For the evil that was perpetrated against the french people

MSP-PODCAST_0500_0181.wav But he sets up this what i think it's really a false argument 
MSP-PODCAST_0500_0183.wav Because he's going to get ready to lay down what he thinks ought to happen 
MSP-PODCAST_0500_0184.wav And before he can do that he has to put in he put as to put into the minds of the listener 
MSP-PODCAST_0500_0185.wav This idea that any sacrifice is necessary whatever it takes under any cost

MSP-PODCAST_0538_0031_0003.wav Though i have to say that i was lucky to escape without either deep emotional wounds or physical ones so i was lucky 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0032.wav Do you get those wounds now the i ma do you understand 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0033_0001.wav I certainly understand them and i sympathize a great deal with feterans returning from morakanef ganstan who have those wounds 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0033_0002.wav And i think both the physical and the emotional wounds are things we don't think very much about beforehand 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0033_0003.wav And we end up thinking about the milot after as a nation we probably ought to think about it more at the beginning 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0033_0004.wav Because those wounds certainly are inevitable 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0034_0001.wav I read that that experience led you to begin thinking really hard about what it means to be human 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0034_0002.wav And i'm ashamed to say that i'm not sure that i ever reflect on that myself i should we all should 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0034_0003.wav But we're not forced you most of us 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0035_0001.wav I think that's right it certainly a an experience that exposes you to a fair amount of inhumanity 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0035_0002.wav I think that causes you to think about all of it in a deeper and dum more continuous way i had a lot of help in that 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0035_0003.wav Most especially when i returned and went back to college i met up with a philosophy professor at my alma mater callret a college who 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0035_0004.wav Had written a beautiful book on his experiences in world or two called the warriors and that book helped me a lot and he helped me a lot 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0035_0005.wav It it helped me not only understand but i think and incorporate my feelings about the experience 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0035_0006.wav Into a a narrative of my life that might not have been positive but it was a workable 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0035_0007.wav It was it was something that ounow i i think i integrated in a certain way and to who i was 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0039.wav And great great thinking about such things 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0040_0001.wav Tell me all the different places you end it up teaching governing all the different institutions and parts of the country 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0040_0002.wav Just to give people of feel for what experience you now bring to the chairmanship of the inny age

MSP-PODCAST_0538_0048.wav Your atam's grandfather i read delightfully did not have coffee each morning but you saw him drinking 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0055_0001.wav I don't recall him saying anything in particular but he he was devoted to this and he was a real man he was a salty maingi 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0055_0002.wav Loved being around him he he lived in an old house in new england in those days when i spent time with him 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0055_0003.wav And had a barn there was attached to the house like many new england houses and his wife 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0055_0004.wav Did not permit him to watch telivision or to drink in the house so he would repair to the barn 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0057_0001.wav There with him we would watch the new york giant's playfootball in the barn next to a big hut putbellystove 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0057_0002.wav He got one channel and he kept a little bottle of bourbon under his chair and would periodically take a nip 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0059.wav Ctually yes he did offer me one from time to time that's nothing i've ever admitted to publiclyf at hite 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0062.wav You had those experiences not because you were growing up in main but you went to a prop school 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0063_0002.wav About a two hour drive from where he lived in main so he would come over and and e gather me up at thanksgiving and other brief holidays 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0063_0003.wav And we go to main and sit in the barn watch tve 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0064_0001.wav So where with all this rich and varied background you had from 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0064_0002.wav Combat zone too the rarefied atmosphere of aleete colleges and prep schools 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0064_0003.wav Do you come from as president do you think a lot of it as sort have summed up in your initiative called the common good 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0065_0001.wav Much of what i've thought and cared about the humanities is present in that initiative whose purpose is to 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0065_0002.wav Join humanity scholars and organizations tora have been calling grand challenges in public life 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0065_0003.wav The founding legislation of any ae cals for the agency to attend to the circumstances of contemporary life 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0065_0004.wav I really like that phrase 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0065_0005.wav And aso i began thinking almost right away about how i could encourage humanity scholars and organizations to 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0065_0006.wav Take that sort of public facing approach to their work and to thereby contribute to the common good to the better men of the country 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0068_0001.wav Ink in some ways however that over the last several decades i think humanity scholars particularly on the academic side of things 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0068_0002.wav Have been drawn into a much more technical and professional and inward facing exercise of the humanities 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0068_0003.wav Specialization became the quinge of the realm in many ways now 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0068_0004.wav That's true in other places too the natural sciences there certainly places where specialization has become necessary but 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0070.wav It caused i think a turning away from ora of a letting alone of the 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0072.wav Important human issues that we all wrestle with personally and as members of the public world 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0074.wav The forms of understanding and knowledge that the humanities offer 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0078.wav Ing issue that we face as a people is 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0080_0001.wav Problem that can be resolved by the application of technology 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0080_0002.wav Their issues that deal with our values our ideas our history and our culture 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0080_0003.wav Those are the areas in which the humanities work 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0080_0004.wav And those are the areas in which most of our very significant public challenges and i would offer personal challenges also emerge 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0080_0005.wav And so we need the forms of understanding and knowledge that the humanities provide to engage those areas of our lives 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0080_0006.wav And encouraging humanity scholars and organizations to do that is one of the principal things i am interested in doing at any age 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0082_0001.wav We are just beginning to understand the ways in which we might fund them 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0082_0002.wav We just announced a new programme in the research division called the public scholar programme 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0082_0003.wav Which is an encouragement to humanity scholars both in the academic world and independence scholors 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0082_0004.wav To turn their work in a more public facing way that is to say to speak to broader audiences 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0082_0005.wav I think we'regoig to get some very interesting proposals 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0083.wav As the very new chairman of an organization just about to celebrate its fiftieth year when was any age founded 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0084_0001.wav Any eight was founded on september twenty ninth nineteen sixty five to be precise

MSP-PODCAST_0538_0084_0003.wav A a wonderful piece of legislation 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0084_0004.wav And of a piece with the other extraordinary legislative moments of that time the civil right's act the voting rights act 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0084_0005.wav It was aa tumultuous decade in so many ways 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0084_0006.wav But in the midst of all this tumult this enormously creative period and e any ich is a product of that period we have four 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0086_0001.wav In dollars in grants made to individuals and organizations over that period of time 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0086_0002.wav Seven thousand grants two individual scholars stochologes and universities libraries museums historical societies 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0086_0003.wav It's a brilliant and very important story

MSP-PODCAST_0538_0089.wav And you find friends of the humanities on both sides of er y 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0090.wav S i do one of the most isle crossing is of course this whole question of historical and cultural legacy in the united states 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0092_0001.wav Es there is no cultural in historical legacy in the country and without the focusd attention of any ah there is no consistent application of the humanities to those issues ol 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0092_0002.wav Only we are charged exclusively with preserving that legacy no other foundation is no other individualis we are and we do 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0093.wav Without the battlefield preservation societies preserved battlefields and libraries preserve what they preserve what are you doing

MSP-PODCAST_0538_0094_0004.wav And many grants have followed in the wake of that we were kenburnes first thunder in his film on the brooklan bridge 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0094_0005.wav Can is please to say and i've heard him say it no any h no kin burns because we were there at the start as we are with many of these organizations and projects 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0094_0006.wav My belief is that the common good the good of this country can't be approached or understood without the work of the humanities 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0094_0007.wav Our history with our culture our values and our ideas all of that is bound up in a very very tight way with the humanities 
MSP-PODCAST_0538_0094_0008.wav And we need to nourish those humanistic ways of thinking and understanding the world in order to have those strong legacies survie

MSP-PODCAST_0561_0025.wav Yat maybe i mean at newsweek i definitely didn't waste money going to graduate school for journralism which i have a lot of friends who did and spend a lot of money and i'm not sure as actually effective was

MSP-PODCAST_0561_0041.wav Like so many things they didn't give them space in the paper ya am and it was really discouraging nice sort of 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0044.wav Do something entirely different and then you know luckily i discovered magazines 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0046.wav Well at the time i was working in newswek iwhich one still havenit i don't know um but certainly it was better than the 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0048.wav The crime flowder that's interesting that you felt like at news whic you would have more long form journalism is what it sounds like to me or oh completely i mean also it was a product of my position there i had risen up 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0050.wav Freedom to dew stuff and i think that ended at being really good training ground for me 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0070.wav Having their byline very frequently in the pages of the magazine and so 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0071.wav It was really frustrating and i ended up turning to the webb to get to do a lot more stuff because at that time that was still considered kind of the ugly steff child of the magiden 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0072.wav Eh but eventually my female colleagues and i started talking about how we were all feeling this 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0080.wav Texd in our time by the writer susan brown miller and left it on my desk with a postet note to a page about the women of newswek 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0087.wav You know sexism for her generation was certainly much much worse 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0088.wav But it almost had a kind of benefit in that you knew it when you saw it it was very clear cut discrimination had a legal definition 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0098.wav Yet i didn't necessarily at first i mean it took some talking 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0099.wav And being really open and vulnerable i think to realize that we all were experiencing the same thing and i think that instinctively 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0101.wav In order to overcome so we got to that point and and then it was very valuable and and 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0104.wav Various other ways of just trying to make sure that the women felt included in this conversation and 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0105.wav That we could talk about it as a group that 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0109.wav I very much like at the times is a magazine approached to newspapers in a way so you get to be more coller we got to be more of a magazine writer within the confints of a newspaper 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0111.wav Tory i wasn't grying to run so you would just keep waiting hoping so i do very much appreciate the idea of you write a thing 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0113.wav Because it internuts too fast and nobody has time and why don't they 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0114.wav Tat you know wht we're not going to go this fast any more we don't need to be a twenty four hour cable nutwork we don't need to we don't need to put out stuff that shitty like why can't you rit i 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0119.wav And so luckily i was still early enough that i adapted really quickly and and became a digital journalist 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0122.wav You have liked seven jobs i i wy nit all ti 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0123.wav Ann if youare a realyance which is which is what ieve now yet you always have am a side gag or maybe 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0125.wav I know a lot of journalists who have freelants journalists who have liked their kind of quiet corporate gigg they maybe their copy writing oki ah nothing with their name on it 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0126.wav And then it allows them to do the thing that they want ter do which doesn't pay iand i actually 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0128.wav Now your never suppose to associate with brands or anything remotely 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0129.wav Connected to a brand and yet how are useful to make a living as a journalist because byasist don't pay so 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0132.wav And it's dill you know like i have multiple jobs and i still do it so i always say like gat some sheety job that pays a lot 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0140.wav At the same time i feel like thereis a real diminishing of what am the priorites are in terms of what is important to be focusing on 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0145.wav So i do worry am about 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0147.wav Awful attributes that i find about male culture and there is allful attributes about female culture these are stereotypic gold tropes but i'm just not sure why we have to lake 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0149.wav Ras i mean it's really tricky i think that some of it is about calling attention to the issues and 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0150.wav If you can call attention to it then you can call the behavior out so just talking about it but things like braga i mean they cury yourself at the confidence of dear gratment so oke 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0155.wav We knew half the time he didn't ur nhewas talking about 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0156.wav But he was a good friend and we liked him and so we would start asking each other  watwould josh w w jd what would josh do in the cinario and we would try to 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0158.wav Well it's also that like the way that we define confidence is by male terms so like deep voices body language like taking up a lot of space like these are male 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0159.wav Attributes and because men have run shit since the dawn of time then we try to mimic that or women are judged by that standard so what happens though 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0160.wav When you adopt all those things well let's pretend im adopting everything correctly um and you still get judged cause you're a female doing that meaningyour 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0176.wav We stand on the shoulder pats of the women who came before us like so so so important at the same time it can be like it's a struggle ocaseo someone 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0177.wav Younger just gets the things that you've been fighting for very easily and that doesn't feel good and so how do you not take that 
MSP-PODCAST_0561_0181.wav That was so gorgeous that said she also did get to have her time in the sun and stand out and have a career that she can really be and should be really impressed withan she
